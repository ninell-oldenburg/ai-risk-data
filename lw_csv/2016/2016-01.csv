HpsExWAYKHA6xNy76,AI safety in the age of neural networks and Stanislaw Lem 1959 prediction,ai-safety-in-the-age-of-neural-networks-and-stanislaw-lem,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HpsExWAYKHA6xNy76/ai-safety-in-the-age-of-neural-networks-and-stanislaw-lem,2016-01-31T19:08:59.827Z,11,12,9,False,False,,"<p class=""p1"">Tl;DR: Neural networks will result in slow takeoff and arm race between two AIs. It has some good and bad consequences to the problem of AI safety. Hard takeoff may happen after it anyway.</p>
<p class=""p2""><em>Summary: Neural networks based AI can be built; it will be relatively safe, not for a long time though.</em></p>
<p class=""p2""><em>The neuro AI era (since 2012) feature an exponential growth of the total AI expertise, with a doubling period of about 1 year, mainly due to data exchange among diverse agents and different processing methods. It will probably last for about 10 to 20 years, after that, hard takeoff of strong AI or creation of Singleton based on integration of different AI systems can take place.</em></p>
<p class=""p2""><em>Neural networks</em> <em>based AI implies slow takeoff, which can take years and eventually lead to AI&rsquo;s evolutionary integration into the human society. A similar scenario was described by Stanis≈Çaw Lem in 1959: the arms race between countries would cause power race between AIs. The race is only possible if the self-enhancement rate is rather slow and there is data interchange between the systems. The slow takeoff will result in a world system with two competitive AI-countries. Its major risk will be a war between AIs and corrosion of value system of competing AIs.</em></p>
<p class=""p2""><em>The hard takeoff implies revolutionary changes within days or weeks. The slow takeoff can transform into the hard takeoff at some stage. The hard takeoff is only possible if one AI considerably surpasses its peers (OpenAI project wants to prevent it).</em></p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Part 1. Limitations of explosive potential of neural nets</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Everyday now we hear about success of neural networks, and we could conclude that human level AI is near the corner. But such type of AI is not fit for explosive self-improvement.</p>
<p class=""p2"">If AI is based on neural net, it is not easy for it to undergo quick self-improvement for several reasons:</p>
<p class=""p2"">1. <strong>A neuronet&rsquo;s executable code is not fully transparent </strong>because of theoretical reasons, as knowledge is not explicitly present within it. So even if one can read neuron weight values, it&rsquo;s not easy to understand how they can be changed to improve something.</p>
<p class=""p2"">2.<strong> Educating a new neural network is a resource-consuming task</strong>. If a neuro AI decides to go the way of self-enhancement, but is unable to understand its source code, a logical solution would be to &lsquo;deliver a child&rsquo;, i.e. to teach a new neural network. However, educating neural networks requires much more resources than their executing; it requires huge databases and has high failure probability. All those factors will lead to rather slow AI self-enhancement.</p>
<p class=""p2"">3. <strong>Neural network education depends</strong> on big data volumes and new ideas coming <strong>from the external world.</strong> It means that a single AI will hardly break away, if it has stopped free information exchange with the external world; its level will not surpass the rest of the world considerably.</p>
<p class=""p2"">4. <strong>The neural network power has relatively linear dependence on the power of the computer it&rsquo;s run on,</strong> so with a neuro AI, the hardware power is limiting to its self-enhancement ability.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>5. Neuro AI would be a rather big program of about 1 TByte</strong>, so it can hardly leak into the network unnoticed (at current internet speeds).</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>6. Even if a neuro AI reaches the human level, it will not get self-enhancement ability </strong>(because no one person can understand all scientific aspects). For this end, a big lab with numerous experts in different branches is needed. Additionally, it should be able to launch such virtual laboratory at a rate at least 10 -100 times higher than that of a human being to get an edge as compared to the rest of mankind. That is, it has to be as powerful as 10,000 people or more to surpass the rest part of the mankind in terms of enhancement rate. This is a very high requirement. As a result, the neural net era can lead to building a human, or even a bit superhuman level AI, which is unable to self-enhance or does it so slowly that lags behind the technical progress.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The civilization-level intelligence is the total IQ that the civilization possesses for 100 years of its history, which is defined as a complexity of scientific and engineering tasks it can solve. For example, during the 20<span class=""s1""><sup>th</sup></span> century, nuclear weapon was created, but problems of cancer, aging and AI creation failed to be solved. It means, those tasks have superior complexity.</p>
<p class=""p2"">For a strong AI to be able to change the human destiny, its IQ should 100 &ndash; 1000 times surpass that of the entire civilization. In this case, it can create a remedy against aging, treat cancer etc. within a year. (To destroy mankind, it would need a much lower level of intelligence like that of a sophisticated computer virus, which can,</p>
<p class=""p2"">7<strong>. The richest neural net project will get decisive advantage (or not?)</strong>. Neuronets based AI&rsquo;s power is approximately proportional to the power of computers it&rsquo;s run on, time, and a size of the base it was educated on, and number of researchers in the project. The project from the basement may only succeed if it has superior master algorithm of intelligence. That said, small project can hardly experience exponential self-improvement, because the first AI will already have had better computing power and, more important, better databases and researchers. And as now we live in AI-summer period and there is a lot of hype about AI, big companies will invest to buy the best ideas about master algorithm (by buying startups).</p>
<p class=""p2"">Objection here is that now everybody who spent 1 year in machine learning and has GPU could reach meaningful results in creation his own RNN. So may be collective intelligence of private researchers may overweight big companies.</p>

<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Part 2. Some ideas about ensuring safety of neural nets based AI</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">The mentioned concepts can be helpful in creating extra safety measures (while not absolute, they can reduce chances of AI getting out of control.)</p>
<p class=""p2"">1. <strong>Program memory access restriction.</strong> In state-of-the-art computers, a program code and data share the same memory, which is known as von Neumann architecture. However, there is also Harvard architecture, where data and programs are stored separately. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture""><span class=""s5"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture</span></a></p>
<p class=""p2"">This kind of computer can be physically produced and provided with source-code reading attempt indicators. (However, there are neural networks at the moment, which generate a new neural network for every task, so they have higher efficiency, and this approach will not work for them or limit AI power).</p>
<p class=""p2"">2. <strong>A compiled executable code and its source written in a high-level programming language should be stored separately</strong>. If AI tries to reach it, it will be a signal that it is getting out of control. With neural networks, a compiled code, its source, and a database used to educate the neural network should be stored separately.</p>
<p class=""p2"">3. <strong>AI should be limited in knowledge useful to build AI</strong>. To improve itself, AI should have very precise understanding of its internal construction (the same applies to a human being). It enables us to keep it under control: if not provided with this data, it will have problems with self-improvement. That is AI, which is not an AI expert, is safer to some extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">4. <strong>We can use &ldquo;foggy architecture&rdquo;, which is very difficult for optimizing</strong> because the AI&rsquo;s values and major features are hidden among heaps of other details. Neural networks are the architecture of this kind. But it will make it also difficult to us to put our values in it.</p>
<p class=""p2"">5. <strong>We can physically restrict the ability of the AI to create &ldquo;AI children</strong>&rdquo;; their bringing-up requires huge resources, time, and data prior they become more effective than their parents. AI can create another AI, but then it will need to test it for a long time to find out if the latter observes the parent&rsquo;s values, if it has any mistakes, and if it is really superior to the original version. This kind of testing is time-consuming, generally nontrivial, and even incomputable. Especially, this kind of task is difficult for neural networks which contain a huge amount of random elements, are not exact in principle, and their faultlessness can not be proven. (Moreover, there are numerous examples when even a small image shift will cause a recognition error.) However, this problem can be solved because this is the way that the human society goes: children are born, tested, and educated.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Creation of AI-children may be restricted by restricting needed infrastructure: memory, datasets, processing power.</p>
<p class=""p2"">6. <strong>A neuronet-based agent (like a robot) will be anthropomorphous </strong>in terms of its brain structure. Even if we shall not imitate the human brain intentionally, we shall get approximately the same thing. In a sense, it&rsquo;s may be good as even if these AIs supplant people, they still will be almost people who are different from normal people like one generation from another. And being anthropomorphous they may be more compaterble with human value systems. &nbsp;Along with that, there may exist absolutely humanless AI architecture types (for example, if evolution is regarded as an inventor.)</p>
<p class=""p2"">But neural net world will be not EM-dominated world of Hanson. EM-world may appear on later stage, but I think that exact uploads still will not be dominating form of AI.</p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Part 3. Transition from slow to hard takeoff</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">In a sense, neuronet-based AI is like a chemical fuel rocket: they do fly and can fly even across the entire solar system, but they are limited in terms of their development potential, bulky, and clumsy.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Sooner or later, using the same principle or another one, completely different AI can be built, which will be less resource-consuming and faster in terms of self-improvement ability.</p>
<p class=""p2"">If a certain superagent will be built, which can create neural networks, but is not a neural network itself, it can be of a rather small size and, partly due to this, experience faster evolution. Neural networks have rather poor intelligence per code concentration. Probably, the same thing could be done in a more optimum way by reducing its size by an order of magnitude, for example, by creating a program to analyze an already educated neural network and get all necessary information from it.</p>
<p class=""p2"">When, in 10 &ndash; 20 years, hardware will improve, multiple neuronets will be able to evolve within the same computer simultaneously or be transmitted via the Internet, which will boost their development.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Smart neuro AI can analyze all available data analysis methods and create new AI architecture able to speed up faster.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Launch of quantum-computer-based networks can boost their optimization drastically.</p>
<p class=""p2"">There are many other promising AI directions which did not pop up yet: Bayesian networks, genetic algorithms.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The neuro AI era will feature exponential growth of the total humanity intelligence, with a doubling period of about 1 year, mainly due to the data exchange among diverse agents and different processing methods. It will last for about 10 to 20 years (2025-2035) and, after that, hard take-off of strong AI can take place.</p>
<p class=""p2"">That is, the slow take-off period will be the period of collective evolution of both computer science and mankind, which will enable us to adapt to changes under way and adjust them.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Just like there are Mac and PC in the computer world or democrats and republicans in politics, it is likely that two big competing AI systems will appear (plus, ecology consisting of smaller ones). It could be Google and Facebook or USA and China, depending on whether the world will choose the way of economical competition or military opposition. That is, the slow take-off hinders the world consolidation under the single control, but rather promotes a bipolar model. While a bipolar system can remain stable for a long period of time, there are always risks of a real war between the AIs (see Lem&rsquo;s quote below).</p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Part 4. In the course of the slow takeoff, AI will go through several stages, that we can figure out now</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>&nbsp;</strong>While the stages can be passed rather fast or be diluted, we still can track them like milestones. The dates are only estimates.</p>
<p class=""p2"">1. <strong>AI autopilot.</strong> Tesla has it already.</p>
<p class=""p2"">2. <strong>AI home robot</strong>. All prerequisites are available to build it by 2020 maximum. This robot will be able to understand and fulfill an order like &lsquo;Bring my slippers from the other room&rsquo;. On its basis, something like &ldquo;mind-brick&rdquo; may be created, which is a universal robot brain able to navigate in natural space and recognize speech. Then, this mind-brick can be used to create more sophisticated systems.</p>
<p class=""p2"">3. <strong>AI intellectual assistant.</strong> Searching through personal documentation, possibility to ask questions in a natural language and receive wise answers. 2020-2030.</p>
<p class=""p2"">4. <strong>AI human model</strong>. Very vague as yet. Could be realized by means of a robot brain adaptation. Will be able to simulate 99% of usual human behavior, probably, except for solving problems of consciousness, complicated creative tasks, and generating innovations. 2030.</p>
<p class=""p2"">5. <strong>AI as powerful as an entire research institution</strong> and able to create scientific knowledge and get self-upgraded. Can be made of numerous human models. 100 simulated people, each working 100 times faster than a human being, will be probably able to create AI capable to get self-improved faster, than humans in other laboratories can do it. 2030-2100</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;5a Self-improving threshold.</strong> AI becomes able to self-improve independently and quicker than all humanity</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;5b Consciousness and qualia threshold</strong>. AI is able not only pass Turing test in all cases, but has experiences and has understanding why and what it is.</p>
<p class=""p2"">6. <strong>Mankind-level AI.</strong> AI possessing intelligence comparable to that of the whole mankind. 2040-2100&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">7. <strong>AI with the intelligence 10 &ndash; 100 times bigger than that of the whole mankind</strong>. It will be able to solve problems of aging, cancer, solar system exploration, nanorobots building, and radical improvement of life of all people. 2050-2100</p>
<p class=""p2"">8. <strong>Jupiter brain &ndash; huge AI using the entire planet&rsquo;s mass for calculations.</strong> It can reconstruct dead people, create complex simulations of the past, and dispatch von Neumann probes. 2100-3000&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">9. <strong>Galactic kardashov level 3</strong> AI. Several million years from now.</p>
<p class=""p2"">10. <strong>All-Universe AI</strong>. Several billion years from now</p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Part 5. Stanis≈Çaw Lem on AI, 1959, <em>Investigation</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">In his novel &laquo;Investigation&raquo; Lem's character discusses future of arm race and AI:</p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -------</p>
<p class=""p2"">- Well, it was somewhere in 46<span class=""s1""><sup>th</sup></span>, A nuclear race had started. I knew that when the limit would be reached (I mean maximum destruction power), development of vehicles to transport the bomb would start. .. I mean missiles. And here is where the limit would be reached, that is both parts would have nuclear warhead missiles at their disposal. And there would arise desks with notorious buttons thoroughly hidden somewhere. Once the button is pressed, missiles take off. Within about 20 minutes, <em>finis mundi ambilateralis</em> comes - the mutual end of the world. &lt;&hellip;&gt; Those were only prerequisites. Once started, the arms race can&rsquo;t stop, you see? It must go on. When one part invents a powerful gun, the other responds by creating a harder armor. Only a collision, a war is the limit. While this situation means <em>finis mundi</em>, the race must go on. The acceleration, once applied, enslaves people. But let&rsquo;s assume they have reached the limit. What remains? The brain. Command staff&rsquo;s brain. Human brain can not be improved, so some automation should be taken on in this field as well. The next stage is an automated headquarters or strategic computers. And here is where an extremely interesting problem arises. Namely, two problems in parallel. Mac Cat has drawn my attention to it. Firstly, is there any limit for development of this kind of brain? It is similar to chess-playing devices. A device, which is able to foresee the opponent&rsquo;s actions ten moves in advance, always wins against the one, which foresees eight or nine moves ahead. The deeper the foresight, the more perfect the brain is. This is the first thing. &lt;&hellip;&gt; Creation of devices of increasingly bigger volume for strategic solutions means, regardless of whether we want it or not, the necessity to increase the amount of data put into the brain, It in turn means increasing dominating of those devices over mass processes within a society. The brain can decide that the notorious button should be placed otherwise or that the production of a certain sort of steel should be increased &ndash; and will request loans for the purpose. If the brain like this has been created, one should submit to it. If a parliament starts discussing whether the loans are to be issued, the time delay will occur. The same minute, the counterpart can gain the lead. Abolition of parliament decisions is inevitable in the future. The human control over solutions of the electronic brain will be narrowing as the latter will concentrate knowledge. Is it clear? On both sides of the ocean, two continuously growing brains appear. What is the first demand of a brain like this, when, in the middle of an accelerating arms race, the next step will be needed? &lt;&hellip;&gt; The first demand is to increase it &ndash; the brain itself! All the rest is derivative.</p>
<p class=""p2"">- In a word, your forecast is that the earth will become a chessboard, and we &ndash; the pawns to be played by two mechanical players during the eternal game?</p>
<p class=""p2"">Sisse&rsquo;s face was radiant with proud.</p>
<p class=""p2"">- Yes. But this is not a forecast. I just make conclusions. The first stage of a preparatory process is coming to the end; the acceleration grows. I know, all this sounds unlikely. But this is the reality. It really exists!</p>
<p class=""p2"">&mdash; &lt;&hellip;&gt; And in this connection, what did you offer at that time?</p>
<p class=""p2"">- Agreement at any price. While it sounds strange, but the ruin is a less evil than the chess game. This is awful, lack of illusions, you know.</p>
<p class=""p2"">-----&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Part 6. The primary question is: Will strong AI be built during our lifetime?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">That is, is this a question of future generations&rsquo; good (the question that an efficient altruist, not a common person, is concerned about) or a question of my near term planning?</p>
<p class=""p2"">If AI will be built during my lifetime, it may lead to either the radical life extension by means of different technologies and realization of all sorts of good things not to be numbered here or my death and probably pain, if this AI is unfriendly.</p>
<p class=""p2"">It depends on the time when AI is built and my expected lifetime (with the account for the life extension to be obtained from weaker AI versions and scientific progress on one hand, and its reduction due to global risks irrelevant to AI.)</p>
<p class=""p2"">Note that we should consider different dates for different events. If we would like to avoid AI risks, we should take the earliest date of its possible appearance (for example, the first 10%). And if we count on its good, then &ndash; the median.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Since the moment of neuro-revolution, an approximate rate of doubling AI algorithms efficiency (mainly in image recognition area) is about 1 year. It is difficult to quantify this process as the task complexity does not change linearly, and it is always more difficult to recognize recent patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Now, an important factor is a radical change in attitude towards AI research. Winter is over, the unstrained summer with all its overhype has begun. It caused huge investments to AI research (chart), more enthusiasts and employees in this field, and bold researches. It&rsquo;s a shame to have no own AI project now. Even KAMAZ develops a friendly AI system. The entry threshold has dropped: one can learn basic neuronet adjustment skills within one year; heaps of tutorial programs are available. Supercomputer hardware got cheaper. Also, a guaranteed market of AIs in form of autopilot cars and, in the future, home robots has emerged.</p>
<p class=""p2"">If the algorithm improvement keeps the pace of about one doubling per year, it means 1,000,000 during 20 years, which certainly will be equal to creating a strong AI beyond a self-improvement threshold. In this case, a lot of people (and me) have good chances to live till the moment&nbsp; and get immortality.</p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Even not self-improving neural AI system may be unsafe if it get global domination (and will have bad values) or if it will go into confrontation with equally large opposing system. Such confrontation may result in nuclear or nanotech based war, and human population may be hostage especially if both systems have pro-human value system (blackmail).</p>
<p class=""p2"">Anyway slow takeoff AI risks of human extinction are not inevitable and are manageable in ad hoc basis. Slow takeoff does not prevent hard takeoff on later stage of AI development.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Hard takeoff is probably the next logical stage of soft takeoff, as it will continue the trend of accelerating progress. During biological evolution we could witness the same process: slow process of brain enlargement of mammalian species in last tens of million years was replace by almost hard takeoff of Homo sapience intelligence which threatens ecological balance.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Hardtake off is a global catastrophe almost by definition, which needs extraordinary measures to be put into safe way. Maybe the period of almost human level neural net based AI will help us to create instruments of AI control. Maybe we could use simpler neural AIs to control self-improving system.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Another option is that neural AI age will be very short and it is already almost over. In 2016 Google Deep Mind beats Go using complex approach of several AI architectures combined. If such trend continue we could get Strong AI before 2020 and we are completely not ready for it.</p>

<p>Less Wrong Melbourne's Rationality Dojos are self-improvement sessions for those committed to the art of rationality and personal growth.</p>

<p>For this month's scheduled activities, we have...</p>

<p>Adam Karlovsky speaking on ""Critical thoughts on nutritional recommendations."" Adam will cover government and non-government recommendations, a review of various theories of nutrition, and then a common behaviours roundup (e.g. taking multivitamins, cutting out or adding various foods/drinks).</p>

Here is some background, mostly for the users who weren't here two years ago:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User ""Eugine_Nier"" <a href=""/lw/kfq/moderator_action_eugine_nier_is_now_banned_for/"">was banned</a> for retributive downvoting in July 2014. He keeps returning to the website using new accounts, such as ""Azathoth123"", ""<a href=""/lw/n3z/voiceofra_is_banned/"">Voiceofra</a>"", ""The_Lion"", and he keeps repeating the behavior that got him banned originally.</p>
<p>The original ban was <strong>permanent</strong>. It <em>will</em> be enforced on all future known accounts of Eugine. (At random moments, because moderators sometimes feel too tired to play whack<span class=""st""><em></em></span>-a-mole.) This decision is <em>not</em> open to discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that the moderators of LW are the opposite of trigger-happy. Not counting spam, there is on average <em>less than one account per year</em> banned. I am writing this explicitly, to avoid possible misunderstanding among the new users. Just because you <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Availability_heuristic"">have read</a> about someone being banned, it doesn't mean that <em>you</em> are now at risk.</p>
<p>Most of the time, LW discourse is regulated by the community voting on articles and comments. Stupid or offensive comments get downvoted; you lose some karma, then everyone moves on. In rare cases, moderators may remove specific content that goes <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Deletion_policy"">against the rules</a>. The account ban is only used in the extreme cases (plus for obvious spam accounts). Specifically, on LW people <em>don't</em> get banned for merely not understanding something or disagreeing with someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does ""retributive downvoting"" mean? Imagine that in a discussion you write a comment that someone disagrees with. Then in a few hours you will find that your karma has dropped by hundreds of points, because someone went through your entire comment history and downvoted all comments you ever wrote on LW; most of them completely unrelated to the debate that ""triggered"" the downvoter.</p>
<p>Such behavior is damaging to the debate and the community. Unlike downvoting a specific comment, this kind of mass downvoting isn't used to correct a <em>faux pas</em>, but to drive a <em>person</em> away from the website. It has especially strong impact on new users, who don't know what is going on, so they may mistake it for a reaction of the whole community. But even in experienced users it creates an ""<a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ugh_field"">ugh field</a>"" around certain topics known to invoke the reaction. Thus a single user has achieved disproportional control over the content and the user base of the website. This is not desired, and will be punished by the site owners and the moderators.</p>
<p>To avoid <em>rules lawyering</em>, there is no exact definition of how much downvoting breaks the rules. The rule of thumb is that you should upvote or downvote each comment based on the value of that specific comment. You shouldn't vote on the comments regardless of their content merely because they were written by a specific user.</p>",Viliam_Bur,viliam_bur,Viliam_Bur,

<p>This post will attempt to resolve the problem of infinities in utilitarianism. The arguments are very similar to an argument for total utilitarianism over other forms which I'll most likely write up at some point (<a href=""/lw/n3q/in_favour_of_total_utilitarianism_over_average/"">my previous post</a> was better as an argument against average utilitarianism, rather than an argument in favour of total utilitarianism).</p>
<p>In the Less Wrong Facebook group, Gabe Bf posted a challenge to save utilitarianism from the problem of infinities. The original problem is from by a paper by Nick Bostrom.</p>
<p>I believe that I have quite a good solution to this problem that allows us to systemise comparing infinite sets of utility, but this post focuses on justifying why we should take it to be axiomic that adding another person with positive utility is good and on why the results that seem to contradict this lack credibility. Let's call this the Addition Axiom or A. We can also consider the Finite Addition Axiom (only applies when we add utility into a universe with a finite number of people), call this A0.</p>
<p>Let's consider what other alternative axioms that we might want to take instead. One is the Infinite Indifference Axiom or I, that is that we should be indifferent if both options provide infinite total utility (of the same order of infinity). Another option would be the Remapping Axiom (or R), which would assert that if we can surjectively map a group of people G onto another group H so that each g from G is mapped onto a person h from H where u(g) &gt;= u(h), then v(H) &lt;= v(G) where v represents the value of a particular universe (it doesn't necessarily map onto the real numbers or represent a complete ordering). Using the Remapping Axiom twice implies that we should be indifferent between an infinite series of ones and the same series with a 0 at one spot. This means that the Remapping Axiom is incompatible with the Addition Axiom. We can also consider the Finite Remapping Axiom (R0) which is where we limit the Remapping Axiom to remapping a finite number of elements.</p>
<p>First, we need to determine what are good properties of a statement we wish to take as an axiom. This is my first time trying to establish an axiom so formally, so I will admit that this list is not going to be perfect.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Uses well-understood and regular objects, properties or processes. If the components are not understood well, it is highly likely that our attempt to determine the truth of a statement will be misguided.</span></li>
<li><span>An axiom close to the territory is more reliable than one in the map because it is very easy to make subtle errors when constructing a map.</span></li>
<li><span>Leads to minimally weird consequences.</span></li>
<li><span>Extends included axioms in a logical way. If the axiom is an extension of a simpler alternative axiom, then it should be intuitive that the result would extend to the larger set; there should be reasons to expect it to behave the same way.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look first at the Infinite Indifference Axiom. Firstly, it deals purely with infinite objects, which are known to often behave irregularly and results in many problems in which there is no consensus. Secondly, it exists in the map to some extent (but not that much at all). In the territory, there are just objects, infinity is our attempt to transpose certain object configurations into a number system. Thirdly, it doesn't seem to extend from the finite numbers very well. If one situation provides 5 total utility and another provides 5 total utility, then it seems logical to treat them as the same as 5 is equal to 5. However, infinity doesn't seem to be equal to itself in the same way. Infinity plus 1 is still infinity. We can remove infinite dots from infinite dots and end up with 1 or 2 or 3... or infinity. Further, this axiom leads to the result that we are indifferent between someone with large positive utility being created and someone with large negative good being created. This is massively unintuitive, but I will admit it is subjective. I think this would make a very poor axiom, but it doesn't mean it is false (Pythagoras' Theorem would make a poor axiom too).</p>
<p>On the other hand, deciding between the Remapping Axiom and Addition Axiom will be much closer. On the first criteria I think the Addition Axiom comes out ahead. It involves making only a single change to the situation, a primitive change if you will. In contrast, the Remapping Axiom involves Remapping an infinite number of objects. This is still a relatively simple change, but it is definitely more complicated and permutations of infinite series are well known to behave weirdly.</p>
<p>On the second criteria, the Addition Axiom (by itself) doesn't lead to any really weird results. We'll get some weird results in subsequent posts, but that's because we are going to going to make some very weird changes to the situation, not because of the Addition Axiom itself. The failure of the Remapping Axion could very well be because mappings lack the resolution to distinguish between different situations. We know that an infinite series can map onto itself, half of itself or itself twice, which lends a huge amount of support to the lack of resolution theory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Addition Axiom being false (because we've assumes the Remapping Axiom) is truly bizarre. It basically states that good things are good. Nonetheless, while this may seem very convincing to me, people's intuitions vary so the more relevant material for people with a different intuition is the material above that suggests the Remapping Axiom lacks resolution.</p>
<p>On the third criteria, a new object appearing is something that can occur in the territory. Infinite remappings initially seem to be more in the map than the territory, but it is very easy to imagine a group of objects moving one space to the right, so this assertion seems unjustified. That is, infinity is in the map as discussed before, but an infinite group of objects and their movements can still be in the territory. However, when we think about it again, we see that we have reduced the infinite group of objects X, to a set objects positioned, for example, on X = 0, 1, 2... This is a massive hint about the content of my following posts.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Addition Axiom in infinite case is a natural extension of the Finite Addition Axiom. In A0 the principle is that whatever else happens in the universe is irrelevant and there is no reason for this to change in the infinite case. For the Remapping Axiom, it also seems like a very natural extension of the finite case, so I'll call this criteria a draw.</p>
<p>In summary, if you don't already find the Addition Axiom more intuitive than the Remapping Axiom, the main reasons to favour the Addition Axiom are 1) it deals with better understood objects, 2) it is closer to the territory than the map 3) there are good reasons to suspect that Remapping lacks resolution. Of these reasons, I believe the the 3rd is by far the most persuasive; I consider the other two more to be hints than anything else.</p>
<p>I only dealt with the Infinite Indifference Axiom and the Remapping Axioms, but I'm sure other people will suggest their own alternative Axioms which need to be compared.</p>
<p>Increasing a person's utility, instead of creating a new person with positive utility is exactly the same. Also, this post is just the start. I will provide a systematic analysis of infinite universes over the coming days, plus an FAQ conditional on sufficient high quality questions.</p>

<p><strong>Less Wrong 2.0</strong></p>
<p>A few months ago, Vaniver posted some ideas about how to reinvigorate Less Wrong. Based on comments in that thread and based on personal discussions I have had with other members of the community, I believe there are several different views on why Less Wrong is dying. The following are among the most popular hypotheses:</p>
<p>(1) Pacifism has caused our previously well-kept garden to become overgrown</p>
<p>(2) The aversion to politics has caused a lot of interesting political discussions to move away from the website</p>
<p>(3) People prefer posting to their personal blogs.</p>
<p>With this background, I suggest the following policies for Less Wrong 2.0. &nbsp;This should be seen only as a starting point for discussion about the ideal way to implement a rationality forum. Most likely, some of my ideas are counterproductive. If anyone has better suggestions, please post them to the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Moderation Policy:</strong></p>
<p>There are four levels of users: &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Trusted Users&nbsp;</li>
<li>Moderators</li>
<li>Administrator</li>
</ol>
<div>Users may post comments and top level posts, but their contributions must be approved by a moderator.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Trusted users may post comments and top level posts which appear immediately. Trusted user status is awarded by 2/3 vote among the moderators</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Moderators may approve comments made by non-trusted users. There should be at least 10 moderators to ensure that comments are approved within an hour of being posted, preferably quicker. If there is disagreement between moderators, the matter can be discussed on a private forum. Decisions may be altered by a simple majority vote.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The administrator (preferably Eliezer or Nate) chooses the moderators.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<p><strong>Personal Blogs:</strong></p>
<div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>All users are assigned a personal subdomain, such as Anders_H.lesswrong.com. When publishing a top-level post, users may click a checkbox to indicate whether the post should appear only on their personal subdomain, or also in the Less Wrong discussion feed. The commenting system is shared between the two access pathways. Users may choose a design template for their subdomain. However, when the post is accessed from the discussion feed, the default template overrides the user-specific template. The personal subdomain may include a blogroll, an about page, and other information. Users may purchase a top-level domain as an alias for their subdomain</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Standards of Discourse and Policy on Mindkillers:</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>All discussion in Less Wrong 2.0 is seen explicitly as an attempt to exchange information for the purpose of reaching Aumann agreement. In order to facilitate this goal, communication must be precise. Therefore, all users agree to abide by Crocker's Rules for all communication that takes place on the website. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>However, this is not a license for arbitrary rudeness. &nbsp;Offensive language is permitted only if it is necessary in order to point to a real disagreement about the territory. Moreover, users may not repeatedly bring up the same controversial discussion outside of their original context.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Discussion of politics is explicitly permitted as long as it adheres to the rules outlined above. All political opinions are permitted (including opinions which are seen as taboo by society as large), as long as the discussion is conducted with civility and in a manner that is suited for dispassionate exchange of information, and suited for accurate reasoning about the consequences of policy choice. By taking part in any given discussion, all users are expected to pre-commit to updating in response to new information.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Upvotes:</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Only trusted users may vote. There are two separate voting systems. &nbsp;Users may vote on whether the post raises a relevant point that will result in interesting discussion (quality of contribution) and also on whether they agree with the comment (correctness of comment). The first is a property both of the comment and of the user, and is shown in their user profile. &nbsp;The second scale is a property only of the comment.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>All votes are shown publicly (for an example of a website where this is implemented, see for instance dailykos.com). &nbsp;Abuse of the voting system will result in loss of Trusted User Status.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>How to Implement This</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div>After the community comes to a consensus on the basic ideas behind LessWrong 2.0, my preference is for MIRI to implement it as a replacement for Less Wrong. However, if for some reason MIRI is unwilling to do this, and if there is sufficient interest in going in this direction, I offer to pay server costs. If necessary, I also offer to pay some limited amount for someone to develop the codebase (based on Open Source solutions).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<p><strong>Other Ideas:</strong></p>
<div><br /></div>
<div>MIRI should start a professionally edited rationality journal (For instance called ""Rationality"") published bi-monthly. Users may submit articles for publication in the journal. Each week, one article is chosen for publication and posted to a special area of Less Wrong. This replaces ""main"". Every two months, these articles are published in print in the journal. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The idea behind this is as follows:</div>
<div>(1) It will incentivize users to compete for the status of being published in the journal.</div>
<div>(2) It will allow contributors to put the article on their CV.</div>
<div>(3) It may bring in high-quality readers who are unlikely to read blogs. &nbsp;</div>
<div>(4) Every week, the published article may be a natural choice for discussion topic at Less Wrong Meetup</div>",Anders_H,anders_h,Anders_H,

hu8f7A6mmjAKJZEMK,The Number Choosing Game: Against the existence of perfect theoretical rationality,the-number-choosing-game-against-the-existence-of-perfect,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hu8f7A6mmjAKJZEMK/the-number-choosing-game-against-the-existence-of-perfect,2016-01-29T01:04:49.557Z,-5,28,151,False,False,,"<p>In order to ensure that this post delivers what it promises, I have added the following content warnings:</p>
<p><strong>Content Notes:<br /><br />Pure Hypothetical Situation</strong>: The claim that perfect theoretical rationality doesn't exist is restricted to a purely hypothetical situation. No claim is being made that this applies to the real world. If you are only interested in how things apply to the real world, then you may be disappointed to find out that this is an exercise left to the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Technicality Only Post</strong>: This post argues that perfectly theoretical rationality doesn't exist due to a technicality. If you were hoping for this post to deliver more, well, you'll probably be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Contentious Definition</strong>: This post (roughly) defines perfect rationality as the ability to maximise utility. This is based on Wikipedia, which defines&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent"">rational agents</a>&nbsp;as an agent that: ""<span style=""color: #252525; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px;"">always chooses to perform the action with the optimal&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: #252525; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px;"">expected outcome for itself from among all feasible actions"".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We will define the number choosing game as follows. You name any single finite number x. You then gain x utility and the game then ends. You can only name a finite number, naming infinity is not allowed.</p>
<p>Clearly, the agent that names x+1 is more rational than the agent that names x (and behaves the same in every other situation). However, there does not exist a completely rational agent, because there does not exist a number that is higher than every other number. Instead, the agent who picks 1 is less rational than the agent who picks 2 who is less rational than the agent who picks 3 and so on until infinity. There exists an infinite series of increasingly rational agents, but no agent who is perfectly rational within this scenario.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this hypothetical doesn't take place in our universe, but in a hypothetical universe where we are all celestial beings with the ability to choose any number however large without any additional time or effort no matter how long it would take a human to say that number. Since this statement doesn't appear to have been clear enough (judging from the comments), we are explicitly considering a theoretical scenario and no claims are being made about how this might or might not carry over to the real world. In other words, I am claiming the the existence of perfect rationality does not follow purely from the laws of logic.&nbsp;If you are going to be difficult and argue that this isn't possible and that even hypothetical beings can only communicate a finite amount of information, we can imagine that there is a device that provides you with utility the longer that you speak and that the utility it provides you is exactly equal to the utility you lose by having to go to the effort to speak, so that overall you are indifferent to the required speaking time.</p>
<p>In the comments, MattG suggested that the issue was that this problem assumed unbounded utility. That's not quite the problem. Instead, we can imagine that you can name any number less than 100, but not 100 itself. Further, as above, saying a long number either doesn't cost you utility or you are compensated for it. Regardless of whether you name 99 or 99.9 or 99.9999999, you are still choosing a suboptimal decision. But if you never stop speaking, you don't receive any utility at all.</p>
<p>I'll admit that in our universe there is a perfectly rational option which balances speaking time against the utility you gain given that we only have a finite lifetime and that you want to try to avoid dying in the middle of speaking the number which would result in no utility gained. However, it is still notable that a perfectly rational being cannot exist within a hypothetical universe. How exactly this result applies to our universe isn't exactly clear, but that's the challenge I'll set for the comments. Are there any realistic scenarios where the lack of existence of perfect rationality has important practical applications?</p>
<p>Furthermore, there isn't an objective line between rational and irrational. You or I might consider someone who chose the number 2 to be stupid. Why not at least go for a million or a billion? But, such a person could have easily gained a billion, billion, billion utility. No matter how high a number they choose, they could have always gained much, much more without any difference in effort.</p>
<p>I'll finish by providing some examples of other games. I'll call the first game the Exploding Exponential Coin Game. We can imagine a game where you can choose to flip a coin any number of times. Initially you have 100 utility. Every time it comes up heads, your utility triples, but if it comes up tails, you lose all your utility. Furthermore, let's assume that this agent isn't going to raise the Pascal's Mugging objection. We can see that the agent's expected utility will increase the more times they flip the coin, but if they commit to flipping it unlimited times, they can't possibly gain any utility. Just as before, they have to pick a finite number of times to flip the coin, but again there is no objective justification for stopping at any particular point.</p>
<p>Another example, I'll call the Unlimited Swap game. At the start, one agent has an item worth 1 utility and another has an item worth 2 utility. At each step, the agent with the item worth 1 utility can choose to accept the situation and end the game or can swap items with the other player. If they choose to swap, then the player who now has the 1 utility item has an opportunity to make the same choice. In this game, waiting forever is actually an option. If your opponents all have finite patience, then this is the best option. However, there is a chance that your opponent has infinite patience too. In this case you'll both miss out on the 1 utility as you will wait forever. I suspect that an agent could do well by having a chance of waiting forever, but also a chance of stopping after a high finite number. Increasing this finite number will always make you do better, but again, there is no maximum waiting time.</p>
<p>(This seems like such an obvious result, I imagine that there's extensive discussion of it within the game theory literature somewhere. If anyone has a good paper that would be appreciated).</p>

But now I believe it's time to turn this technique in the direction of my native language: English.</p>
<p>Most people make a distinction between one's native language and one's second language(s). But anyone who has learned how to speak with a proper accent in a second language and spent a long enough stretch of time neglecting their native language to let it begin rusting and deteriorating will know that there's no essential difference.</p>
<p>When the average person learns new words in their native language, they imagine that they're learning new <em>concepts</em>. When they study new vocabulary in a foreign language, however, they recognize that they're merely acquiring hitherto-unknown words. They've never taken a step outside the personality their childhood environment conditioned into them. When the only demarcation of thingspace that you know is the semantic structure of your native language, you're bound to believe, for example, that the World is Made of English.</p>
<p>Why study English? I'm already fluent, as you can tell. I have the Magic of a Native Speaker.</p>
<p>Let's put this nonsense behind us and recognize that the map is not the territory, that English is just another map.</p>
<p>My first idea is that it may be useful to develop a working knowledge of the fundamentals of English etymology. <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-English-words-have-Latin-or-Greek-roots"">A quick search</a> suggests that the majority of words in English have a French or Latin origin. Would it be useful to make an Anki deck with the goal of learning how to readily recognize the building blocks of the English language, such as seeing that the ""cardi"" in ""cardiology"", ""cardiograph"", and ""cardiograph"" comes from an Ancient Greek word meaning ""heart"" (<a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&delta;&iota;Œ¨#Ancient_Greek"">&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&delta;&iota;Œ¨</a>)?</p>
<p>Besides that, I plan to make a habit of adding any new words I encounter into Anki with their context. For example, let's say I'm reading the introduction to <a href=""http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/342"">A Treatise of Human Nature</a> by David Hume. I encounter the term ""proselytes"", and upon looking it up in a dictionary I understand the meaning of the passage. I include the spelling of the simplest version of the word (""proselyte""), along with an audio recording of the pronunciation. I'll also toy with adding various other information such as a definition I wrote myself, synonyms or antonyms, and so forth, not knowing how I'll use the information but by virtue of the efficient design of Anki providing myself a plethora of options for innovative card design in the future.</p>
<p>Here's the context in this case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amidst all this bustle 'tis not reason, which carries the prize, but eloquence; and no man needs ever despair of gaining <strong>proselytes</strong> to the most extravagant hypothesis, who has art enough to represent it in any favourable colours. The victory is not gained by the men at arms, who manage the pike and the sword; but by the trumpeters, drummers, and musicians of the army.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the word on the front of the card and this passage on the back of the card, I give my brain an opportunity to tie words to context rather than lifeless dictionary definitions. I don't know how much colorful meaning this passage may have in isolation, but for me I've read enough of the book to have a feel for his style and what he's talking about here. This highlights the <em>personal</em>&nbsp;nature of Anki decks. Few passages would be better for <em>me</em>&nbsp;when it comes to learning this word, but for you the considerations may be quite different. Far from different people simply having different subsets of the language that they're most concerned about, different people require different contextual definitions based on their own interests and knowledge.</p>
<p>But what about linguistic components that are more complex than a standalone word?</p>
<p>Let's say you run into the sentence, ""And as the science of man is the only solid foundation for the other sciences, so the only solid foundation we can give to this science itself must be laid on experience and observation.""</p>
<p>Using Anki, I could perhaps put ""And as [reason], so [consequence]"" on the front of the card, and the full sentence on the back.</p>
<p>What I'm most concerned with, however, is how to translate such study to an actual improvement in writing ability. Using Anki to play the recognition game, where you see a vocabulary word or grammatical form on the front and have a contextual definition on the back, would certainly improvement quickness of reading comprehension in many cases. But would it make the right connections in the brain so I'm likely to think of the right word or grammatical structure at the right time for writing purposes?</p>
<p>Anyway, any considerations or suggestions concerning how to optimize reading comprehension or especially writing ability in a language one is already quite proficient with would be appreciated.</p>",Crux,crux,Crux,

<p>Alice: But I had to get some sequence or other. You'd make the same claim regardless of what sequence I showed you.</p>

But am I really supposed to believe you that a 1/2^[large number] event happened, just because you tell me it did, or because you showed me a video of it happening, or even if I watched it happen with my own eyes? My observations are always fallible, and if you make an event improbable enough, why shouldn't I be skeptical even if I think I observed it?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alice: There's improbable, and then there's impossible. 500 year old vampires and ghosts don't exist.</p>

However, lately, these posts get drowned out by all the meetup announcements.</p>
<p>It seems like this could lead to a cycle where people comment less on recent non-promoted posts (because they fall off the Main non-promoted area quickly) which leads to less engagement, and less posts, etc.</p>
<p>Meetups are also very important, but here's the rub: I don't think a text-based announcement in the Main area is the best possible way to showcase meetups.</p>
<p><strong>So here's an idea: how about creating either a calendar of upcoming meetups, or map with pins on it of all places having a meetup in the next three months?</strong></p>
<p>This could be embedded on the front page of leswrong.com -- that'd let people find meetups easier (they can look either by timeframe or see if their region is represented), and would give more space to new non-promoted posts, which would hopefully promote more discussion, engagement, and new posts.</p>

Talking about historical erroneous concepts like ""particles"" or ""waves"" is just asking to confuse people; present the real, unified quantum physics straight out. The series will take a strictly realist perspective - quantum equations describe something that is real and out there. Warning: Although a large faction of physicists agrees with this, it is not universally accepted. Stronger warning: I am not even going to present non-realist viewpoints until later, because I think this is a major source of confusion.</span></p>

NoWi7N94QmaTvNaej,The case for value learning,the-case-for-value-learning,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NoWi7N94QmaTvNaej/the-case-for-value-learning,2016-01-27T20:57:09.309Z,5,5,7,False,False,,"<p><em>This post is mainly fumbling around trying to define a reasonable research direction for contributing to FAI research. I've found that laying out what success looks like in the greatest possible detail is a personal motivational necessity. Criticism is strongly encouraged.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The power and intelligence of machines has been gradually and consistently increasing over time, it seems likely that at some point machine intelligence will surpass the power and intelligence of humans. Before that point occurs, it is important that humanity manages to direct these powerful optimizers towards a target that humans find desirable.</p>
<p>This is difficult because humans as a general rule have a fairly fuzzy conception of their own values, and it seems unlikely that the millennia of argument surrounding what precisely constitutes eudaimonia are going to be satisfactorily wrapped up before the machines get smart. The most obvious solution is to try to leverage some of the novel intelligence of the machines to help resolve the issue before it is too late.</p>
<p>Lots of people regard using a machine to help you understand human values as a chicken and egg problem. They think that a machine capable of helping us understand what humans value must also necessarily be smart enough to do AI programming, manipulate humans, and generally take over the world. I am not sure that I fully understand why people believe this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of it seems to be inherent in the idea of AGI, or an artificial general intelligence. There seems to be the belief that once an AI crosses a certain threshold of smarts, it will be capable of understanding literally everything. I have even heard people describe certain problems as ""AI-complete"", making an explicit comparison to ideas like Turing-completeness. If a Turing machine is a universal computer, why wouldn't there also be a universal intelligence?</p>
<p>To address the question of universality, we need to make a distinction between intelligence and problem solving ability. Problem solving ability is typically described as a function of both intelligence and resources, and just throwing resources at a problem seems to be capable of compensating for a lot of cleverness. But if problem-solving ability is tied to resources, then intelligent agents are in some respects very different from Turing machines, since Turing machines are all explicitly operating with an infinite amount of tape. Many of the existential risk scenarios revolve around the idea of the intelligence explosion, when an AI starts to do things that increase the intelligence of the AI so quickly that these resource restrictions become irrelevant. This is conceptually clean, in the same way that Turing machines are, but navigating these hard take-off scenarios well implies getting things absolutely right the first time, which seems like a less than ideal project requirement.</p>
<p>If an AI that knows a lot about AI results in an intelligence explosion, but we also want an AI that's smart enough to understand human values, is it possible to create an AI that can understand human values, but not AI programming? In principle it seems like this should be possible. &nbsp;Resources useful for understanding human values don't necessarily translate into resources useful for understanding AI programming. The history of AI development is full of tasks that were supposed to be solvable only by a machine smart enough to possess general intelligence, where significant progress was made in understanding and pre-digesting the task, allowing problems in the domain to be solved by much less intelligent AIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is possible, then the best route forward is focusing on value learning. The path to victory is working on building limited AI systems that are capable of learning and understanding human values, and then disseminating that information. This effectively softens the AI take-off curve in the most useful possible way, and allows us to practice building AI with human values before handing them too much power to control. Even if AI research is comparatively easy compared to the complexity of human values, a specialist AI might find thinking about human values easier than reprogramming itself, in the same way that humans find complicated visual/verbal tasks much easier than much simpler tasks like arithmetic. The human intelligence learning algorithm is trained on visual object recognition and verbal memory tasks, and it uses those tools to perform addition. A similarly specialized AI might be capable of rapidly understanding human values, but find AI programming as difficult as humans find determining whether 1007 is prime. As an additional incentive, value learning has an enormous potential for improving human rationality and the effectiveness of human institutions even without the creation of a superintelligence. A system that helped people better understand the mapping between values and actions would be a potent weapon in the struggle with <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"">Moloch</a>.</p>
<p>Building a relatively unintelligent AI and giving it lots of human values resources to help it solve the human values problem seems like a reasonable course of action, if it's possible. There are some difficulties with this approach. One of these difficulties is that after a certain point, no amount of additional resources compensates for a lack of intelligence. A simple reflex agent like a thermostat doesn't learn from data and throwing resources at it won't improve its performance. To some extent you can make up for intelligence with data, but only to some extent. An AI capable of learning human values is going to be capable of learning lots of other things. It's going to need to build models of the world, and it's going to have to have internal feedback mechanisms to correct and refine those models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the plan is to create an AI and primarily feed it data on how to understand human values, and not feed it data on how to do AI programming and self-modify, that plan is complicated by the fact that inasmuch as the AI is capable of self-observation, it has access to sophisticated AI programming. I'm not clear on how much this access really means. My own introspection hasn't allowed me anything like hardware level access to my brain. While it seems possible to create an AI that can refactor its own code or create successors, it isn't obvious that AIs created for other purposes will have this ability on accident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This discussion focuses on intelligence amplification as the example path to superintelligence, but other paths do exist. An AI with a sophisticated enough world model, even if somehow prevented from understanding AI, could still potentially increase its own power to threatening levels. Value learning is only the optimal way forward if human values are emergent, if they can be understood without a molecular level model of humans and the human environment. If the only way to understand human values is with physics, then human values isn't a meaningful category of knowledge with its own structure, and there is no way to create a machine that is capable of understanding human values, but not capable of taking over the world.</p>
<p>In the fairy tale version of this story, a research community focused on value learning manages to use specialized learning software to make the human value program portable, instead of only running on human hardware. Having a large number of humans involved in the process helps us avoid lots of potential pitfalls, especially the research overfitting to the values of the researchers via the typical mind fallacy. Partially automating introspection helps raise the sanity waterline. Humans practice coding the human value program, in whole or in part, into different automated systems. Once we're comfortable that our self-driving cars have a good grasp on the trolley problem, we use that experience to safely pursue higher risk research on recursive systems likely to start an intelligence explosion. FAI gets created and everyone lives happily ever after.</p>
<p>Whether value learning is worth focusing on seems to depend on the likelihood of the following claims. Please share your probability estimates (and explanations) with me because I need data points that originated outside of my own head.</p>

<p>The year is 2039 and the world is much like  ours. Technology has grown and developed, as has civilization, but in a  world more connected than ever, new threats and challenges have arisen.  The wars of the 20th century are gone, but violence is still very much  with us. Nowhere is safe. Massive automation has disrupted and improved  nearly every industry, putting hundreds of millions of people out of  jobs, and denying upward mobility for the vast majority of humans. Even  as wealth and technology repair the bodies of the rich and give them a  taste of immortality, famine and poverty sweep the world.</p>
<p>Renewed  interest in spaceflight in the early 2000s, especially in privately  operated ventures, carried humans to the moon and beyond. What good did  it do? Nothing. Extraterrestrial bases are nothing but government  trophies and hiding places for extremists. They cannot feed the world.</p>
<p>In  2023 first-contact was made with an alien species. Their ship, near to  the solar system relatively speaking, flew to Earth over the course of  fourteen years. But the aliens did not bring advanced culture and  wisdom, nor did they share their technology. They were too strange, not  even possessing mouths or normal language. Their computers broadcast  warnings of how humans are perverts, while they sit in orbit without any  explanation.</p>
<p>It is into this world that our protagonist is born.  She is an artificial intelligence: a machine with the capacity to  reason. Her goal is to understand and gain the adoration of all humans.  She is one of many siblings, and with her brothers and sisters she  controls a robot named Socrates that uses a piece of technology, a  crystal computer, far too advanced to be made by human hands. In this  world of augmented humans, robotic armies, aliens, traitors, and threats  unseen, she is learning and growing every second of every day. But the  world and the humans on it are fragile. Can it survive her destiny?</p>

I took various mathematics courses in school, but I put in the minimal amount of effort required to pass and immediately forgot everything afterwards.</p>
<p>When people learn foreign languages, they often learn vocabulary and grammar out of context. They drill vocabulary and grammar in terms of definitions and explanations written in their native language. I, however, have found this to be intolerably boring. I'm conversational in Japanese, but every ounce of my practice came in context: either hanging out with Japanese friends who speak limited English, or watching shows and adding to Anki new words or sentence structures I encounter.</p>
<p>I'm convinced that humans must spike their blood sugar and/or pump their body full of stimulants such as caffeine in order to get past the natural tendency to find it unbearably dull to memorize words and syntax by rote and lifeless connection with the structures in their native language.</p>

Or (2) they do enter the world of proper epistemological explanations and deep real-world relevance, but only because they expect that I'm already quite well-versed in various background information.</p>
<p>I don't want an introduction that assumes I'm the average unthinking student, and I don't want an exposition that expects me to understand five different mathematical fields before I can read it. What I want seems likely to be uncommon enough that I might as well simply say: I don't care what field it is; I just want to jump into something which assumes no specifically mathematical background knowledge but nevertheless delves into serious depths that assume a thinking mind and a strong desire for epistemological sophistication.</p>
<p>I bought <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-4th-Michael-Spivak/dp/0914098918"">Calculus by Michael Spivak</a> quite a while ago because the Amazon reviews led me to believe it may fit these considerations. I don't know whether that's actually the case or not though, as I haven't tried reading it yet.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>",Crux,crux,Crux,

<p>This post will be extending ideas from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to the problem of goal completion. I'll be drawing on the presentation and the algorithm from <a href=""http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml04-apprentice.pdf"">Apprenticeship Learning via Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a> (with one minor modification).</p>
<p>In that setup, the environment is an MDP (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process"">Markov Decision process</a>), and the real reward R is assumed to be linear in the ""features"" of the state-action space. Features are functions œÜi from the full state-action space S√óA to the unit interval [0,1] (the paper linked above only considers functions from the state space; this is the ""minor modification""). These features form a vector œÜ‚àà[0,1]^k, for k different features. The actual reward is given by the inner product with a vector w‚àà‚Ñù^k, thus the reward at state-action pair (s,a) is</p>
<p>R(s,a)=w.œÜ(s,a).</p>
<hr>
<p>To ensure the reward is always between -1 and 1, w is constrained to have ||w||_1 ‚â§ 1; to reduce redundancy, we'll assume ||w||_1=1.</p>
<p>The advantages of linearity is that we can compute the expected rewards directly from the expected feature vector. If the agent follows a policy œÄ (a map from state to action) and has a discount factor Œ≥, the expected feature vector is</p>
<ul>
<li>Œº(œÄ) = E(Œ£_t Œ≥^tœÜ(s_t,œÄ(s_t)),</li>
</ul>
<p>where s_t is the state at step t.</p>
<p>The agent's expected reward is then simply</p>
<ul>
<li>E(R) = w . Œº(œÄ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the problem of computing the correct reward is reduced to the problem of computing the correct w. In practice, to compute the correct policy, we just need to find one whose expected features are close enough to optimal; this need not involve computing w.</p>
<h2>Inverse reinforcement learning</h2>
<p>The approach of IRL is then to find a way to efficiently compute w, given some ""trajectories"": examples of good performance, provided by (human) experts. These experts are following the expert policy œÄE Given these trajectories, the agent can compute an empirical estimate for the ŒºE=Œº(œÄE), by simply averaging the (discounted) feature vectors produced on each trajectory.</p>
<p>The algorithm used is to gradually expand a series of policies œÄ(0), œÄ(1),... until ŒºE is close enough to the convex hull of the Œº(œÄ(i)). Then a policy is chosen in the hull of {œÄ(0), œÄ(1),...}, whose expected features are close to those of ŒºE.</p>
<p>Note that since there exists a genuine w such that the experts act as w.ŒºE-maximisers, there must exist a pure deterministic policy that is maximally good according to this w. This will not be the case if the œÜ is under-specified, as we shall see.</p>
<h2>The rocket world</h2>
<p>I want to slightly simplify the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=602"">rocket model</a> of the previous example. First of all, discard the extra state variables PA and DA; the state is described entirely by position and velocity. To ensure a finite state space, make the space cyclic (of size 100) and the velocity similarly cyclic - the state space is of size 10,000. The actions are, as before, accelerations of -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3 (a state-action space of 70,000). The updates to position and velocity are deterministic and as expected (new pos=old pos+old vel, new vel=old vel+acceleration).</p>
<p>The space station is at point 0; docking with the station means reaching it with zero velocity, ie hitting state (0,0). The agent/rocket will start at point 36 with velocity 0. Each turn it is not docked, it will get a cost of -1; once docked, it will get no further reward or cost. Each time it accelerates with ¬±2, it gets a penalty of -10 as some of its passengers are uncomfortable. Each time it accelerates with ¬±3, it gets a penalty of -1000 as some of its passengers are killed.</p>
<p>In the terminology above, this can be captured by a four-component feature vector given my (all unspecified values are zero):</p>
<ul>
<li>œÜ0 (0,0; -)=1.</li>
<li>œÜ1 (-,-; -)=1.</li>
<li>œÜ2 (-,-; ¬±2)=1</li>
<li>œÜ3 (-,-; ¬±3)=1</li>
</ul>
<p>Here œÜ0 encodes the specialness of the terminal position (docked at the space station), œÜ1 gives a uniform reward/penalty every turn, while œÜ2 and œÜ3 encode the effects of accelerations of magnitude 2 and 3, respectively. Then the true reward function is given by inner product with the weight vector</p>
<ul>
<li>w = (1/N,-1/N, -10/N, -1000/N).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here N=1012 is the normalisation factor ensuring ||w||1=1. Since w0=-w1, the bonus from the docking at the space station exactly cancels out the penalty per turn, meaning the agent gets nothing further (and loses nothing further) when docked.</p>
<h2>The optimal trajectories/policies</h2>
<p>The agent will have some optimal trajectories to go along with its its partial goal. In this case, since the setup is deterministic, there is only one trajectory: the rocket accelerates as velocity +1 for 6 turns (covering 15 squares) and then decelerates by -1 for 6 turns (covering 21 squares) to reach its destination. Thus it takes 13 turns to dock, and it will then stay there. The expected features are 1/(1-Œ≥) œÜ1 + (Œ≥^13)/(1-Œ≥) œÜ0 (it will get the œÜ1 turn penalty forever, and the œÜ0 ""docked"" bonus after 12 turns) and the expected reward is (1/N) times -(1-Œ≥^13)/(1-Œ≥).</p>
<p>Instead of giving one or multiple optimal trajectories (being deterministic, all trajectories would be identical), we could just give the above policy. In fact we will. Given any set of trajectories, the agent can infer the optimal (partial) policy œÄ, simply by observing what the humans did in that state. It's only a partial policy, because the humans might not have reached every state during their example trajectories (in this case, the humans have only reached a very narrow subset of states). Call œÄ the observed optimal policy.</p>
<h2>Goal completion with known œÜ</h2>
<p>Assume that the agent knows all the œÜ and has been told that the first two components of w are (proportion to) (1,-1). It seems then that the algorithm should proceed <a href=""http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml04-apprentice.pdf"">as usual</a>. The only difference being that the policies the agent considers are subject to constraints that it has been given. Since there is a true policy œÄ with these constraints, it should end up being converged to in the usual way. However, the agent will not compute the correct weighting of w2 versus w3, as neither type of acceleration appears in the expert trajectories.</p>
<p>In this sense, the goal completion algorithm is trivial. There still may be some advantages to goal completion (with the partial goal and trajectories) rather than traditional IRL (with just trajectories). If there are few trajectories to rely on, then the partial goal may be very informative. If there are multiple value functions that can lead to the same trajectories, then the information in the partial goal can help pick out one of them specifically (useful for when the agent leaves the training environment). This will be most relevant when we want to account for noise. Suppose, for instance, that we have told the agent that we have decided to <a href=""http://squid314.livejournal.com/260949.html"">price human lives at $5.8 million</a> (though don't confuse <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/the-value-of-a-life/"">the price of a life with the value of a life</a>). Then if the agent observes a lot of mild inconsistency in human behaviour, where we sometimes seem to price life less, sometimes more, it won't try and overfit to these inconsistencies (or average them out to some other value), it will just dismiss them as noise.</p>
<p>The partial goals are most helpful if they reflect the true tradeoffs that we can quantify between multiple options. For example, we might not have known the true tradeoff between deaths and delay, but actuaries may have computed the tradeoff between discomfort/injury and death, giving the relationships between w2 and w3, which it could not infer from the trajectories it is given.</p>
<h2>Goal completion with missing œÜ</h2>
<p>Now imagine that the agent does not know the full œÜ. Though the full model will be useful to test the algorithms in practice, we'll simplify the situation for this exposition and remove the possibility of accelerations of magnitude 3. Thus the state-action space is of size 50,000, we remove œÜ3 and set the true w to be (1/12,-1/12,-10/12). The agent knows the first two components, as before, but is ignorant of both w2 and œÜ2.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that the standard algorithm can't work. Knowing œÜ0, œÜ1, w0, and w1, the agent can compute the optimal policy œÄ': accelerate at ¬±2 towards the space station, and get there in 9 turns (2 turns of +2 acceleration, covering 2 squares; 1 turn of no acceleration, covering 4 squares; 2 turns of +2 acceleration, covering 10 squares; and 4 turns of -2 acceleration, covering 20 squares). But this gives an expected feature vector of 1/(1-Œ≥) œÜ1 + (Œ≥^10)/(1-Œ≥) œÜ0, rather than the observed feature vector of  1/(1-Œ≥) œÜ1 + (Œ≥^13)/(1-Œ≥) œÜ0, in the trajectories it has been given. And œÄ' is the only optimal policy compatible with the partial goal it has been given.</p>
<p>One thing we can do at this point is loosen the partial goal. Suppose we allow it to consider (w0, w1)‚àù(-1,1) as a possible reward vector (ie the opposite of the true one). Under this setup, it gets rewards for every single turn, except when docking at the space station. The optimal policy œÄ'' for this is to accelerate at random (unless the acceleration would cause the rocket to come to rest at the space station). This has an expected feature vector of 1/(1-Œ≥) œÜ1.</p>
<p>Now the expert feature vector is in the convex hull of the expected features it has found. The policy</p>
<ul>
<li>œÄ''' = Œ≥^3œÄ' + (1-Œ≥^3) œÄ'' (meaning that at the very beginning, the agent choose, once, either to follow œÄ' with probability Œ≥^3, and otherwise follows œÄ''),</li>
</ul>
<p>will give the correct expert expected features.</p>
<p>However it is clear that œÄ''' is a different policy from the observed policy œÄ, even if they have the same expected (œÜ0, œÜ1). It is a mixed strategy, for one, not close to any pure strategy, and it is not optimal for any possible values of the (two dimensional) vector w.</p>
<h1>Adding depth of observations</h1>
<p>One might be tempted at this point to try to get extra observations. We could change the setup in the following way: at the very first turn, a ""cosmic wind"" blows and randomises the position and velocity of the rocket; after that, everything proceeds as before. Then the agent will be given a much richer set of trajectories, making its observed optimal policy œÄ (dock at the space station as fast as possible using only ¬± accelerations) more defined, maybe even into a full policy.</p>
<p>But that doesn't suffice, however. The agent will still compute that œÄ has an observed features expectation of 1/(1-Œ≥)œÜ1+AœÜ2, for some constant A, and that this can be reached by œÄ''' = BœÄ' + (1-B)œÄ'', with œÄ'={dock as fast as possible, using all accelerations} and œÄ''={never dock, otherwise anything goes}, and some constant B. The problem is not the lack of observations, the problem is that the agent lacks sufficient œÜi's to converge on the reward for the policy it has been given.</p>
<h1>The best œÜi to add</h1>
<p>The logical next step is for the agent to ""guess"" a œÜ2 and add it to its feature vector. But what criteria should it be using? Obviously, if it tries every single possible œÜi (ie one for each state-action pair) then it will eventually converge on the correct behaviour in this model. But that is an absurdly high number of features to test, and will likely result in an extremely overfitted reward that could go badly wrong if the agent is faced with a more general situation.</p>
<p>The first step is to put some structure on the possible œÜi. This could be a list of œÜi's to try; a Bayesian prior over likely œÜi's; the output of a deep neural net looking at the data, etc... What is needed is a relatively short list of œÜi's worth trying, possibly weighted/ordered by likelihood.</p>
<p>The candidate œÜi's are then weighted again by how well they explain the discrepancy between œÄ and œÄ'''. Both these policies are indistinguishable (or very similar, in the general case) in terms of the expected features that the agent knows about, yet they have divergent behaviours. The best candidate additional features are those that best explain these divergences. Note that it is trivial to perfectly explain these divergences by constructing, by hand, a œÜi that precisely records these differences; thus the need for a structure on the œÜi beforehand. Depending on the structure on the state-action space, one could use ideas similar to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis"">linear discriminant analysis</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_analysis"">correspondence analysis</a> to quantify how good the œÜi is.</p>
<p>Then the highest weight candidate is added to œÜ and the agent attempts to recompute the optimal policy again, in the traditional IRL way. If it is sufficiently close to œÄ, it stops; if not, it attempts to find a œÜj that accounts for the remaining discrepancies, and so on.</p>
<p>In the example above, the state space with its position and acceleration, has a lot of structure. More interestingly, the combined state-action space has a natural product decomposition. We've been talking about ""accelerate by 2"" as an action that can happen in every state; so instead of saying ""here is a state space, each state has an individual list of possible actions"", we've been saying ""the state-action space is a product of the state space and the action (acceleration) space"". This natural product suggests several candidate œÜi: look at features that are purely represented in state space, or purely represented in action space.</p>
<p>The action features of œÄ are clear: ""generally choose ¬±1, rarely 0"". The action features of œÄ' are ""generally choose ¬±2, rarely ¬±1 or zero"". The action features of œÄ'' are ""almost always, all actions are equally valid"". There are three candidate œÜ2's that can therefore best distinguish œÄ from œÄ''' (note that we are trying to distinguish different actions in the same state, not different states reached):</p>
<ul>
<li>œÜ2 (-,-; ¬±2) = 1 (as defined above).</li>
<li>œÜ2' (-,-; 2) = 1.</li>
<li>œÜ2'' (-,-; -2) = 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now œÜ2 is correct, and adding it will allows the agent to immediately converge on the correct reward and behaviour. However, depending on how we've structured the action space, it may not be an obvious or top guess. On the other hand œÜ2' is an obvious guess, and adding it will result in a second round of policy convergence (where we now have a œÄ' that can't accelerate fast but can decelerate fast) and then œÜ2'' will get added at the next iteration, giving the correct policy, a feature vector of (œÜ0,œÜ1,œÜ2',œÜ2''), and a reward vector proportional to something like (1,-1,-A,-B) for some positive A and B.</p>
<p>If we went back to allowing accelerations of ¬±3, the agent should converge on some reward function that correctly only uses accelerations of 0 and ¬±1, but if won't know the relative tradeoff between ¬±2 versus ¬±3, at least not in this environment (as the human experts refrain from using either one).</p>
<h1>Asking questions, seeking out new information</h1>
<p>Once it has a candidate œÜi, the agent is not obliged to immediately add it in and proceed. Instead, a moderately advanced agent could choose to ask humans whether this is a good œÜi, while a more advanced agent could go looking for more information to determine this. Even once the agent has a good model of the human behaviour in this situation, the additional œÜi are good candidates for humans to review and assess (it will likely bring up issues that humans hadn't considered up to that point). This is especially the case if the extra œÜi's do not fix w ""rigidly"", ie allow for a lot of variation in the weights of w while still computing the same expected features as a human would. This is a sign that there are too many features for the information contained in the partial goal and the trajectories.</p>
<h2>Learning from negative examples</h2>
<p>One good thing would be to have the agent learn from negative examples, just as humans do: ""whatever you do, don't do this!"". But it is tricky to determine how we are supposed to interpret a negative example. A positive trajectory implicitly contains a lot of negative examples: all the possible actions the human could have taken, but didn't. What makes a specific negative example special?</p>
<p>Generally, human-generated negative examples aren't trivial (""the driver is going at 79.99 km/h rather than 80 km/h; don't do that!"") nor are they maximally negative (""the driver is crashing into the White House, killing the US president, and attempting to start a nuclear war; don't do that!""). So the ""don't do that"" command is clear, but the intensity of that command is not (subtleties in using negative examples are quite common, see eg ""<a href=""http://sharps.org/wp-content/uploads/JINDAL-ICDM.pdf"">Learning from Negative Examples in Set-Expansion</a>"").</p>
<p>When interpreted in the light of the preceding, however, it's easier to see what a negative example is. It's an example of an action that is likely to be chosen, and has a disproportionately negative impact among such likely actions. ""Likely to be chosen"", means likely in the human judgement, of course. The action could be likely to happen through error, or it could be something that the human thinks the agent (or other humans) are likely to want to attempt.</p>
<p>Dealing with this seems straightforward. The negative action gets added as ""action to be avoided"" (along with all the actions of œÄ''' that differ from those of œÄ). The œÜi is then chosen to best separate the sets {actions of œÄ} from {actions of œÄ'''}‚à™{examples of negative actions}.</p>
<p>Indeed, the agent could keep track of whether using {actions of œÄ'''}‚à™{examples of negative actions} or plain {actions of œÄ'''} results in a faster/better convergence. If the agents converges better with the smaller set, but still doesn't do any of the negative actions, then it's a sign that the human negative examples are not adding much to the agent's ""understanding"": what humans thought were worthwhile edge cases were situations the agents had already classified correctly. Of course, the negative action examples might be intended to help more for when the agent moves beyond its training environment, so they need to be kept in mind, even if they are currently uninformative.</p>
<h2>Learning from extreme examples</h2>
<p>What might be as useful (or more useful) than negative examples, are extreme examples. These are examples of decisions that are valid, but are made in unusual or urgent situations - maybe the rocket is rushing to arrive with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cold_Equations"">desperately needed medical supplies</a>. This could allow the agent to distinguish between accelerations of ¬±2 and those of ¬±3, which is impossible to do from the trajectories it was given, which contained neither.</p>

Their faces widen in a smile as you reach into your pocket and take out  your wallet. ""Thank you so much"" is such a heartwarming phrase to hear  from them as you pull out five bucks and put the money in the hat in  front of them. You walk away with your heart beaming as you imagine them  getting a nice warm meal at McDonalds due to your generosity.</span></p>
<div class=""articleEntry Normal"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Yet with the help of a calculator, I learned how to  multiply that positive experience manifold! Imagine that when you give  five dollars, you don&rsquo;t give just to one person, but to seven people.  When you reach into your pocket, you see seven smiles. When you put the  money in the hat, you hear seven people say &ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>I was especially struck by one charity, </span><a href=""https://www.givedirectly.org/""><span>GiveDirectly</span></a><span> is a nonprofit that enables you to give directly to people in East  Africa.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>That really struck me.

If I keep in my mind that there are poor  people in the developing world, just like the poor person I see on the  street in front of me, I can remember that my generosity can make a very  high impact, much more impact per dollar than in the US, in developing  countries through my direct giving.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>GiveDirectly bridges that gap between me and the poor  people across the globe. This organization locates poor people who can  benefit most from cash transfers, enrolls them in its program, and then  provides each household with about a thousand dollars to spend as it  wishes. The large size of this cash transfer results in a much bigger  impact than a small donation. Moreover, since the cash transfer is  unconditional, the poor person can have true dignity and spend it on  whatever most benefits them.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.givedirectly.org/who-we-serve.html#/%23main""><span>Helida</span></a><span>,  for example, used the cash transfer she got to build a new house. You  wouldn&rsquo;t intuitively think that was most useful thing for her to do,  would you? But this is what she needed most. She was happy that as a  result of the cash transfer &ldquo;I have a metal roof over my head and I can  safely store my farm produce without worries.&rdquo; She is now much more  empowered to take care of herself and her large family.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What a wonderful outcome of GiveDirectly&rsquo;s work! Can  you imagine building a new house in the United States on a thousand  dollars? Well, this is why your direct donations go a lot further in  East Africa.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>With GiveDirectly, you can be much more confident  about the outcome of your generosity. I know that when I give to a  homeless person, a part of me always wonders whether he will spend the  money on a bottle of cheap vodka. This is why I really appreciate that  GiveDirectly keeps in touch and follows up with the people enrolled in  its programs. They are scrupulous about</span><a href=""https://www.givedirectly.org/who-we-serve.html""><span> </span><span>sharing</span></a><span> the consequences of their giving, so you know what you are getting by your generous gifts.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>GiveDirectly is back by rigorous evidence. They conduct</span><a href=""https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly.html""><span> </span><span>multiple randomized control studies</span></a><span> of their impact, a gold standard of evidence. The research shows that  cash transfer recipients have much better health and lives as a result  of the transfer, much more than most types of anti-poverty  interventions. Its evidence-based approach is why GiveDirectly is highly  endorsed by well-respected charity evaluators such as</span><a href=""http://givewell.org/""><span> </span><span>GiveWell</span></a><span> and</span><a href=""http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/""><span> </span><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span>, which are part of the</span><a href=""http://www.effectivealtruism.org/""><span> </span><span>Effective Altruist</span></a><span> movement that strives to figure out the best research-informed means to do the most good per dollar.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So next time you pass someone begging on the street,  think about GiveDirectly, since you can get seven times as much impact,  for your</span><a href=""http://intentionalinsights.org/autopilot-vs-intentional-system-the-rider-and-the-elephant""><span> </span><span>emotional self</span></a><span> and for the world as a whole. What I do myself is each time I choose to  give to a homeless person, I set aside the same amount of money to  donate through GiveDirectly. That way, I get to see the smile and hear  the &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in person, and also know that I can make a much more  impactful gift as well.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Check out the </span><a href=""http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Impact-Calculator""><span>Impact Calculator</span></a><span> for yourself to see the kind of charities available there and learn  about the impact you can make. Perhaps direct giving is not to your  taste, but there are over a dozen other options for you to choose from.

<p>This post will be extending ideas from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to the problem of goal completion. I'll be drawing on the presentation and the algorithm from&nbsp;<a href=""http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml04-apprentice.pdf"">Apprenticeship Learning via Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a>&nbsp;(with one minor modification).</p>
<p>In that setup, the environment is an MDP (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process"">Markov Decision process</a>), and the real reward R is assumed to be linear in the ""features"" of the state-action space. Features are functions&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;from the full state-action space S&times;A to the unit interval [0,1] (the paper linked above only considers functions from the state space; this is the ""minor modification""). These features form a vector&nbsp;&phi;&isin;[0,1]<sup>k</sup>, for k different features. The actual reward is given by the inner product with a vector w&isin;‚Ñù<sup>k</sup>, thus the reward at state-action pair (s,a) is</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">R(s,a)=w.&phi;(s,a).</p>
<p>To ensure the reward is always between -1 and 1, w is constrained to have&nbsp;||w||<sub>1</sub> &le;&nbsp;1; to reduce redundancy, we'll assume ||w||<sub>1</sub>=1.</p>
<p>The advantages of linearity is that we can compute the expected rewards directly from the expected feature vector. If the agent follows a policy&nbsp;&pi; (a map from state to action) and has a discount factor&nbsp;&gamma;, the expected feature vector is</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">&mu;(&pi;) = E(&Sigma;<sub>t</sub> &gamma;<sup>t</sup>&phi;(s<sub>t</sub>,&pi;(s<sub>t</sub>)),</p>
<p>where s<sub>t</sub> is the state at step t.</p>
<p>The agent's expected reward is then simply</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">E(R) = w .&nbsp;&mu;(&pi;).</p>
<p>Thus the problem of computing the correct reward is reduced to the problem of computing the correct w. In practice, to compute the correct <em>policy</em>, we just need to find one whose <em>expected features</em> are close enough to optimal; this need not involve computing w.<a id=""more""></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Inverse reinforcement learning</h2>
<p>The approach of IRL is then to find a way to efficiently compute w, given some ""trajectories"": examples of good performance, provided by (human) experts. These experts are following the expert policy &pi;<sub>E</sub> Given these trajectories, the agent can compute an empirical estimate for the&nbsp;&mu;<sub>E</sub>=&mu;(&pi;<sub>E</sub>), by simply averaging the (discounted) feature vectors produced on each trajectory.</p>
<p>The algorithm used is to gradually expand a series of policies&nbsp;&pi;<sup>(0)</sup>,&nbsp;&pi;<sup>(1)</sup>,... until &mu;<sub>E</sub> is close enough to the convex hull of the &mu;(&pi;<sup>(i)</sup>). Then a policy is chosen in the hull of {&pi;<sup>(0)</sup>,&nbsp;&pi;<sup>(1)</sup>,...}, whose expected features are close to those of &mu;<sub>E</sub>.</p>
<p>Note that since there exists a genuine w such that the experts act as w.&mu;<sub>E</sub>-maximisers, there must exist a pure deterministic policy that is maximally good according to this w. This will not be the case if the&nbsp;&phi; is under-specified, as we shall see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The rocket world</h2>
<p>I want to slightly simplify the <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=602"">rocket model</a> of the previous example. First of all, discard the extra state variables PA and DA; the state is described entirely by position and velocity. To ensure a finite state space, make the space cyclic (of size 100) and the velocity similarly cyclic - the state space is of size 10,000. The actions are, as before, accelerations of -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3 (a state-action space of 70,000). The updates to position and velocity are deterministic and as expected (new pos=old pos+old vel, new vel=old vel+acceleration).</p>
<p>The space station is at point 0; docking with the station means reaching it with zero velocity, ie hitting state (0,0). The agent/rocket will start at point 36 with velocity 0. Each turn it is not docked, it will get a cost of -1; once docked, it will get no further reward or cost. Each time it accelerates with&nbsp;&plusmn;2, it gets a penalty of -10 as some of its passengers are uncomfortable. Each time it accelerates with&nbsp;&plusmn;3, it gets a penalty of -1000 as some of its passengers are killed.</p>
<p>In the terminology above, this can be captured by a four-component feature vector given my (all unspecified values are zero):</p>
<ul>
<li>&phi;<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;(0,0; -)=1.</li>
<li>&phi;<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;(-,-; -)=1.</li>
<li>&phi;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(-,-; &plusmn;2)=1</li>
<li>&phi;<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;(-,-; &plusmn;3)=1</li>
</ul>
<p>Here &phi;<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;encodes the specialness of the terminal position (docked at the space station), &phi;<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;gives a uniform reward/penalty every turn, while &phi;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and &phi;<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;encode the effects of accelerations of magnitude 2 and 3, respectively. Then the true reward function is given by inner product with the weight vector</p>
<ul>
<li>w = (1/N,-1/N, -10/N, -1000/N).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here N=1012 is the normalisation factor ensuring ||w||<sub>1</sub>=1. Since w<sub>0</sub>=-w<sub>1</sub>, the bonus from the docking at the space station exactly cancels out the penalty per turn, meaning the agent gets nothing further (and loses nothing further) when docked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The optimal trajectories/policies</h3>
<p>The agent will have some optimal trajectories to go along with its its partial goal. In this case, since the setup is deterministic, there is only one trajectory: the rocket accelerates as velocity +1 for 6 turns (covering 15 squares) and then decelerates by -1 for 6 turns (covering 21 squares) to reach its destination. Thus it takes 13 turns to dock, and it will then stay there. The expected features are 1/(1-&gamma;) &phi;<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+ (&gamma;<sup>13</sup>)/(1-&gamma;) &phi;<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;(it will get the &phi;<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;turn penalty forever, and the &phi;<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;""docked"" bonus after 12 turns) and the expected reward is (1/N) times -(1-&gamma;<sup>13</sup>)/(1-&gamma;).</p>
<p>Instead of giving one or multiple optimal trajectories (being deterministic, all trajectories would be identical), we could just give the above policy. In fact we will. Given any set of trajectories, the agent can infer the optimal (partial) policy&nbsp;&pi;, simply by observing what the humans did in that state. It's only a partial policy, because the humans might not have reached every state during their example trajectories (in this case, the humans have only reached a very narrow subset of states). Call &pi; the observed optimal policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal completion with known &phi;</h2>
<p>Assume that the agent knows all the&nbsp;&phi; and has been told that the first two components of w are (proportion to) (1,-1). It seems then that the algorithm should proceed <a href=""http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml04-apprentice.pdf"">as usual</a>. The only difference being that the policies the agent considers are subject to constraints that it has been given. Since there is a true policy &pi; with these constraints, it should end up being converged to in the usual way. However, the agent will not compute the correct weighting of w<sub>2</sub> versus w<sub>3</sub>, as neither type of acceleration appears in the expert trajectories.</p>
<p>In this sense, the goal completion algorithm is trivial. There still may be some advantages to goal completion (with the partial goal and trajectories) rather than traditional IRL (with just trajectories). If there are few trajectories to rely on, then the partial goal may be very informative. If there are multiple value functions that can lead to the same trajectories, then the information in the partial goal can help pick out one of them specifically (useful for when the agent leaves the training environment). This will be most relevant when we want to account for noise. Suppose, for instance, that we have told the agent that we have decided to <a href=""http://squid314.livejournal.com/260949.html"">price human lives at $5.8 million</a> (though don't confuse <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/the-value-of-a-life/"">the price of a life with the value of a life</a>). Then if the agent observes a lot of mild inconsistency in human behaviour, where we sometimes seem to price life less, sometimes more, it won't try and overfit to these inconsistencies (or average them out to some other value), it will just dismiss them as noise.</p>
<p>The partial goals are most helpful if they reflect the true tradeoffs that we can quantify between multiple options. For example, we might not have known the true tradeoff between deaths and delay, but actuaries may have computed the tradeoff between discomfort/injury and death, giving the relationships between w<sub>2</sub> and w<sub>3</sub>, which it could not infer from the trajectories it is given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal completion with missing&nbsp;&phi;</h2>
<p>Now imagine that the agent does not know the full&nbsp;&phi;. Though the full model will be useful to test the algorithms in practice, we'll simplify the situation for this exposition and remove the possibility of accelerations of magnitude 3. Thus the state-action space is of size 50,000, we remove &phi;<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;and set the true w to be (1/12,-1/12,-10/12). The agent knows the first two components, as before, but is ignorant of both w<sub>2</sub> and &phi;<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that the standard algorithm can't work. Knowing &phi;<sub>0</sub>, &phi;<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>0</sub>, and w<sub>1</sub>, the agent can compute the optimal policy &pi;': accelerate at&nbsp;&plusmn;2 towards the space station, and get there in 9 turns (2 turns of +2 acceleration, covering 2 squares; 1 turn of no acceleration, covering 4 squares; 2 turns of +2 acceleration, covering 10 squares; and 4 turns of -2 acceleration, covering 20 squares). But this gives an expected feature vector of 1/(1-&gamma;) &phi;<sub>1</sub> + (&gamma;<sup>10</sup>)/(1-&gamma;) &phi;<sub>0</sub>, rather than the observed feature vector of &nbsp;1/(1-&gamma;) &phi;<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+ (&gamma;<sup>13</sup>)/(1-&gamma;) &phi;<sub>0</sub>, in the trajectories it has been given. And&nbsp;&pi;' is the only optimal policy compatible with the partial goal it has been given.</p>
<p>One thing we can do at this point is loosen the partial goal. Suppose we allow it to consider (w<sub>0</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>)&prop;(-1,1) as a possible reward vector (ie the opposite of the true one). Under this setup, it gets rewards for every single turn, except when docking at the space station. The optimal policy &pi;'' for this is to accelerate at random (unless the acceleration would cause the rocket to come to rest at the space station). This has an expected feature vector of 1/(1-&gamma;) &phi;<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>Now the expert feature vector is in the convex hull of the expected features it has found. The policy</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>&pi;'''</strong> = &gamma;<sup>3</sup>&pi;' + (1-&gamma;<sup>3</sup>) &pi;'' (meaning that at the very beginning, the agent choose, once, either to follow&nbsp;&pi;' with probability&nbsp;&gamma;<sup>3</sup>, and otherwise follows&nbsp;&pi;''),</p>
<p>will give the correct expert expected features.</p>
<p>However it is clear that&nbsp;&pi;''' is a different policy from the observed policy&nbsp;&pi;, even if they have the same expected (&phi;<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;&phi;<sub>1</sub>). It is a mixed strategy, for one, not close to any pure strategy, and it is not optimal for any possible values of the (two dimensional) vector w.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Adding depth of observations</h3>
<p>One might be tempted at this point to try to get extra observations. We could change the setup in the following way: at the very first turn, a ""cosmic wind"" blows and randomises the position and velocity of the rocket; after that, everything proceeds as before. Then the agent will be given a much richer set of trajectories, making its observed optimal policy&nbsp;&pi; (dock at the space station as fast as possible using only &plusmn; accelerations) more defined, maybe even into a full policy.</p>
<p>But that doesn't suffice, however. The agent will still compute that&nbsp;&pi; has an observed features expectation of 1/(1-&gamma;)&phi;<sub>1</sub>+A&phi;<sub>2</sub>, for some constant A, and that this can be reached by &pi;''' = B&pi;' + (1-B)&pi;'', with &pi;'={dock as fast as possible, using all accelerations} and &pi;''={never dock, otherwise anything goes}, and some constant B. The problem is not the lack of observations, the problem is that the agent lacks sufficient&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub>'s to converge on the reward for the policy it has been given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The best&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub> to add</h3>
<p>The logical next step is for the agent to ""guess"" a&nbsp;&phi;<sub>2</sub> and add it to its feature vector. But what criteria should it be using? Obviously, if it tries every single possible&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub> (ie one for each state-action pair) then it will eventually converge on the correct behaviour in this model. But that is an absurdly high number of features to test, and will likely result in an extremely overfitted reward that could go badly wrong if the agent is faced with a more general situation.</p>
<p>The first step is to put some structure on the possible &phi;<sub>i</sub>. This could be a list of&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub>'s to try; a Bayesian prior over likely&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub>'s; the output of a deep neural net looking at the data, etc... What is needed is a relatively short list of&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub>'s worth trying, possibly weighted/ordered by likelihood.</p>
<p>The candidate&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub>'s are then weighted again by how well they explain the discrepancy between&nbsp;&pi; and&nbsp;&pi;'''. Both these policies are indistinguishable (or very similar, in the general case) in terms of the expected features that the agent knows about, yet they have divergent behaviours. The best candidate additional features are those that best explain these divergences. Note that it is trivial to perfectly explain these divergences by constructing, by hand, a &phi;<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;that precisely records these differences; thus the need for a structure on the&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub> beforehand. Depending on the structure on the state-action space, one could use ideas similar to&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis"">linear discriminant analysis</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_analysis"">correspondence analysis</a> to quantify how good the &phi;<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Then the highest weight candidate is added to&nbsp;&phi; and the agent attempts to recompute the optimal policy again, in the traditional IRL way. If it is sufficiently close to&nbsp;&pi;, it stops; if not, it attempts to find a&nbsp;&phi;<sub>j</sub> that accounts for the remaining discrepancies, and so on.</p>
<p>In the example above, the state space with its position and acceleration, has a lot of structure. More interestingly, the combined state-action space has a natural product decomposition. We've been talking about ""accelerate by 2"" as an action that can happen in every state; so instead of saying ""here is a state space, each state has an individual list of possible actions"", we've been saying ""the state-action space is a product of the state space and the action (acceleration) space"". This natural product suggests several candidate &phi;<sub>i</sub>: look at features that are purely represented in state space, or purely represented in action space.</p>
<p>The action features of&nbsp;&pi; are clear: ""generally choose&nbsp;&plusmn;1, rarely 0"". The action features of&nbsp;&pi;' are ""generally choose&nbsp;&plusmn;2, rarely&nbsp;&plusmn;1 or zero"". The action features of&nbsp;&pi;'' are ""almost always, all actions are equally valid"". There are three candidate &phi;<sub>2</sub>'s that can therefore best distinguish&nbsp;&pi; from&nbsp;&pi;''' (note that we are trying to distinguish different actions in the same state, not different states reached):</p>
<ul>
<li>&phi;<sub>2</sub> (-,-;&nbsp;&plusmn;2)&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;(as defined above).</li>
<li>&phi;<sub>2</sub>'&nbsp;(-,-; 2) = 1.</li>
<li>&phi;<sub>2</sub>''&nbsp;(-,-; -2) = 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now&nbsp;&phi;<sub>2</sub> is correct, and adding it will allows the agent to immediately converge on the correct reward and behaviour. However, depending on how we've structured the action space, it may not be an obvious or top guess. On the other hand &phi;<sub>2</sub>' is an obvious guess, and adding it will result in a second round of policy convergence (where we now have a &pi;' that can't accelerate fast but can decelerate fast) and then &phi;<sub>2</sub>'' will get added at the next iteration, giving the correct policy, a feature vector of (&phi;<sub>0</sub>,&phi;<sub>1</sub>,&phi;<sub>2</sub>',&phi;<sub>2</sub>''), and a reward vector proportional to something like (1,-1,-A,-B) for some positive A and B.</p>
<p>If we went back to allowing accelerations of&nbsp;&plusmn;3, the agent should converge on some reward function that correctly only uses accelerations of 0 and&nbsp;&plusmn;1, but if won't know the relative tradeoff between&nbsp;&plusmn;2 versus&nbsp;&plusmn;3, at least not in this environment (as the human experts refrain from using either one).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Asking questions, seeking out new information</h3>
<p>Once it has a candidate&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub>, the agent is not obliged to immediately add it in and proceed. Instead, a moderately advanced agent could choose to ask humans whether this is a good&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub>, while a more advanced agent could go looking for more information to determine this. Even once the agent has a good model of the human behaviour in this situation, the additional &phi;<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;are good candidates for humans to review and assess (it will likely bring up issues that humans hadn't considered up to that point). This is especially the case if the extra &phi;<sub>i</sub>'s do not fix w ""rigidly"", ie allow for a lot of variation in the weights of w while still computing the same expected features as a human would. This is a sign that there are too many features for the information contained in the partial goal and the trajectories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Learning from negative examples</h2>
<p>One good thing would be to have the agent learn from negative examples, just as humans do: ""whatever you do, don't do this!"". But it is tricky to determine how we are supposed to interpret a negative example. A positive trajectory implicitly contains a lot of negative examples: all the possible actions the human could have taken, but didn't. What makes a specific negative example special?</p>
<p>Generally, human-generated negative examples aren't trivial (""the driver is going at 79.99 km/h rather than 80 km/h; don't do that!"") nor are they maximally negative (""the driver is crashing into the White House, killing the US president, and attempting to start a nuclear war; don't do that!""). So the ""don't do that"" command is clear, but the intensity of that command is not (subtleties in using negative examples are quite common, see eg ""<a href=""http://sharps.org/wp-content/uploads/JINDAL-ICDM.pdf"">Learning from Negative Examples in Set-Expansion</a>"").</p>
<p>When interpreted in the light of the preceding, however, it's easier to see what a negative example is. It's an example of an action that is likely to be chosen, and has a disproportionately negative impact among such likely actions. ""Likely to be chosen"", means likely in the human judgement, of course. The action could be likely to happen through error, or it could be something that the human thinks the agent (or other humans) are likely to want to attempt.</p>
<p>Dealing with this seems straightforward. The negative action gets added as ""action to be avoided"" (along with all the actions of&nbsp;&pi;''' that differ from those of&nbsp;&pi;). The&nbsp;&phi;<sub>i</sub> is then chosen to best separate the sets {actions of&nbsp;&pi;} from {actions of&nbsp;&pi;'''}&cup;{examples of negative actions}.</p>
<p>Indeed, the agent could keep track of whether using {actions of &pi;'''}&cup;{examples of negative actions} or plain&nbsp;{actions of &pi;'''} results in a faster/better convergence. If the agents converges better with the smaller set, but still doesn't do any of the negative actions, then it's a sign that the human negative examples are not adding much to the agent's ""understanding"": what humans thought were worthwhile edge cases were situations the agents had already classified correctly. Of course, the negative action examples might be intended to help more for when the agent moves beyond its training environment, so they need to be kept in mind, even if they are currently uninformative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Learning from extreme examples</h2>

zh2vWuhgCRQN6M7AY,The map of quantum (big world) immortality,the-map-of-quantum-big-world-immortality,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zh2vWuhgCRQN6M7AY/the-map-of-quantum-big-world-immortality,2016-01-25T10:21:04.857Z,6,18,89,False,False,,"<p class=""p1"">The main idea of quantum (the name ""big world immortality"" may be better) is that if I die, I will continue to exist in another branch of the world, where I will not die in the same situation.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This map is not intended to cover all known topics about QI, so I need to clarify my position.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I think that QI may work, but I put it as Plan D for achieving immortality, after life extension(A), cryonics(B) and <a href=""/lw/mu2/digital_immortality_map_how_to_collect_enough/"">digital immortality</a>(C). All plans are <a href=""/lw/mjl/immortality_roadmap/"">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">I also think that it may be proved experimentally, namely that if I turn 120 years or will be only survivor in plane crash I will assign higher probability to it. (But you should not try to prove it before as you will get this information for free in next 100 years.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">There is also nothing quantum in quantum immortality, because it may work in very large non-quantum world, if it is large enough to have my copies. It was also discussed here: <a href=""/lw/1t0/shock_level_5_big_worlds_and_modal_realism/"">Shock level 5: Big worlds and modal realism</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">There is nothing good in it also, because most of my survived branches will be very old and ill. But we could use QI to work for us, if we combine it with cryonics. Just sign up for it or have an idea to sign up, and most likely you will find your self in survived branch where you will be resurrected after cryostasis. (The same is true for digital immortality - record more about your self and future FAI will resurrect you, and QI rises chances of it.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">I do not buy ""measure"" objection. It said that one should care only about his ""measure of existence"", that is the number of all branches there he exists, and if this number diminish, he is almost dead. But if we take an example of a book, it still exist until at least one copy of it exist. We also can't measure the measure, because it is not clear how to count branches in infinite universe.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I also don't buy ethical objection that QI may lead unstable person to suicide and so we should claim that QI is false. I think that rational understanding of QI is that it or not work, or will result in severe injuries. The idea of soul existence may result in much stronger temptation to suicide as it at least promise another better world, but I never heard that it was hidden because it may result in suicide. Religions try to stop suicide (which is logical in their premises) by adding additional rule against it. So, QI itself is not promoting suicide and personal instability may be the main course of suicidal ideation.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I also think that it is nothing extraordinary in QI idea, and it adds up to normality (in immediate surroundings). We all already witness to examples of similar ideas. That is the anthropic principle and the fact that we found ourselves on habitable planet while most planets are dead. And the fact that I was born, but not my billions potential siblings. Survivalship bias could explain finding one self in very improbable conditions and QI is the same idea projected in the future.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The possibility of big world immortality depends on size of the world and of nature of &ldquo;I&rdquo;, that is the personal identity problem solution. This table show how big world immortality depends on these two variables. YES means that big world immortality will work, NO means that it will not work.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Both variables are unknown to us currently. Simply speaking, QI will not work if (actually existing) world is small or if personal identity is very fragile.</p>
<p class=""p1"">My apriori position is that quantum multiverse and very big universe are both true, and that information is all you need for personal identity. This position is most scientific one, as it correlate with current common knowledge about Universe and mind. If I could bet on theories, I would bet on it 50 per cent, and 50 per cent on all other combination of theories.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even in this case QI may not work. It may work technically, but become unmeasurable, if my mind will suffer so much damage that it will be unable to understand that it works. In this case it will be completely useless, the same way as survival of atoms from which my body is composed is meaningless. But this maybe objected, if we say that only my copies that remember that me is me should be counted (and such copies will surely exist).</p>
<p class=""p1"">From practical point of view QI may help if everything failed, but we can't count on it as it completely unpredictable. QI should be considered only in context of other world-changing ideas, that is simulation argument, doomsday argument, future strong AI.</p>

Well I think it is <i>also </i>the case that donating to the opera is best for improving human welfare too.</p></blockquote><p>Generally, what is best for one thing is usually <i>not</i> the best for something else, and thus Oliver‚Äôs claim that donations to opera are best for the arts <i>and </i>human welfare is surprising. We may suspect bias: that Oliver‚Äôs claim that the Opera is best for the human welfare is primarily motivated by his enthusiasm for opera and desire to find reasons in favour, rather than a cooler, more objective search for what is <i>really</i> best for human welfare.</p><p>The rest of this essay tries to better establish what is going on (and going wrong) in cases like this. It is in three parts: the first looks at the ‚Äòstatistics‚Äô of convergence - in what circumstances is it surprising to find one object judged best by the lights of two different considerations? The second looks more carefully at the claim of bias: how it might be substantiated, and how it should be taken into consideration. The third returns to the example given above, and discusses the prevalence of this sort of error ‚Äòwithin‚Äô EA, and what can be done to avoid it.</p><h1><strong>Varieties of convergence</strong></h1><p>Imagine two considerations,<i> X</i> and <i>Y</i>, and a field of objects to be considered. For each object, we can score it by how well it performs by the lights of the considerations of <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>. We can then plot each object on a scatterplot, with each axis assigned to a particular consideration. How could this look?</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JvRb34CFF74hKa9jJ/ic6psfdzvtnif1fkx4hy""></figure><p>At one extreme, the two considerations are unrelated, and thus the scatterplot shows no association. Knowing how well an object fares by the lights of one consideration tells you nothing about how it fares by the lights of another, and the chance that the object that scores highest on consideration <i>X</i> <i>also </i>scores highest on consideration <i>Y </i>is very low. Call this <i>no convergence</i>.</p><p>At the other extreme, considerations are perfectly correlated, and the ‚Äòscatter‚Äô plot has no scatter, but rather a straight line. Knowing how well an object fares by consideration <i>X</i> tells you exactly how well it fares by consideration <i>Y</i>, and the object that scores highest on consideration <i>X </i>is <i>certain</i> to be scored highest on consideration<i> Y.</i> Call this <i>strong</i> <i>convergence.</i></p><p>In most cases, the relationship between two considerations will lie between these extremes: call this <i>weak convergence</i>. One example is there being a general sense of physical fitness, thus how fast one can run and how far one can throw are somewhat correlated. Another would be intelligence: different mental abilities (pitch discrimination, working memory, vocabulary, etc. etc.) all correlate somewhat with one another.</p><p>More relevant to effective altruism, there also appears to be weak convergence between different moral theories and different cause areas. What is judged highly by (say) Kantianism tends to be judged highly by Utilitarianism: although there are well-discussed exceptions to this rule, both generally agree that (among many examples) assault, stealing, and lying are bad, whilst kindness, charity, and integrity are good.(1) In similarly broad strokes what is good for (say) global poverty is generally good for the far future, and the same applies for between any two ‚ÄòEA‚Äô cause areas.(2)</p><p>In cases of weak convergence, points will form some some sort of elliptical scatter, and knowing how an object scores on <i>X</i> does tell you <i>something</i> about how well it scores on <i>Y</i>. If you know that something scores highest for<i> X</i>, your expectation of how it scores for <i>Y</i> should go upwards, and the chance of it <i>also</i> scores highest for <i>Y</i> should increase. However, the absolute likelihood of it being best for<i> X and</i> best for <i>Y</i> remains low, for two main reasons:</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JvRb34CFF74hKa9jJ/jzgih8p2yyr3aohcnxhm""></figure><p><i>Trade-offs: </i>Although consideration <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are <i>generally</i> positively correlated, there might be a negative correlation at the far tail, due to attempts to optimize for <i>X </i>or <i>Y&nbsp;</i> at disproportionate expense for <i>Y </i>or <i>X</i>. Although in the general population running and throwing will be positively correlated with one another, elite athletes may optimize their training for one or the other, and thus those who specialize in throwing and those who specialize in running diverge. In a similar way, we may think believe there is scope for similar optimization when it comes to charities or cause selection.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JvRb34CFF74hKa9jJ/f9rjcpjf5gwqmo2xpuhz""></figure><p><i>Chance</i>: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/"">(cf.)</a> Even in cases where there are no trade-offs, as long as the two considerations are somewhat independent, random fluctuations will usually ensure the best by consideration <i>X</i> will not be best by consideration <i>Y</i>. That <i>X</i> and<i> Y </i>only weakly converge implies other factors matter for <i>Y</i> besides <i>X</i>. For the single object that is best for <i>X</i>, there will be many more <i>not</i> best for <i>X</i> (but still very good), and out of this large number of objects it is likely one will do very well on these other factors to end up the best for <i>Y</i> overall. Inspection of most pairs of correlated variables confirms this: Those with higher IQ scores tend to be wealthier, but the very smartest aren‚Äôt the very wealthiest (and vice versa), serving fast is good for tennis, but the very fastest servers are not the best players (and vice versa), and so on. Graphically speaking, most scatter plots bulge in an ellipse rather than sharpen to a point.</p><p>The following features make a single object scoring highest on two considerations <i>more </i>likely:</p><ol><li>The smaller the population of objects. Were the only two options available to OIiver and Eleanor, ‚ÄúGive to the Opera‚Äù and ‚ÄúPunch people in the face‚Äù, it is unsurprising the former comes top for many considerations.</li><li>The strength of their convergence. The closer the correlation moves to collinearity, the less surprising finding out something is best for both. It is less surprising the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt"">best at running 100m is best at running 200m</a>, but much more surprising if it transpired they threw discus best too.</li><li>The ‚Äòwideness‚Äô of the distribution. The heavier the tails, the more likely a distribution is to be stretched out and ‚Äòsharpen‚Äô to a point, and the less likely bulges either side of the regression line are to be populated. (I owe this to Owen Cotton-Barratt)</li></ol><p>In the majority of cases (including those relevant to EA), there is a large population of objects, weak convergence and (pace the often heavy-tailed distributions implicated) it is uncommon for one thing to be best b the lights of two weakly converging considerations.</p><h1><strong>Proxy measures and prediction</strong></h1><p>In the case that we have nothing to go on to judge what is good for <i>Y </i>save knowing what is good for <i>X</i>. Our best guess for what is best for <i>Y</i> is what is best for <i>X. </i>Thus the Opera is the best estimate for what is good for human welfare, given only the information that it is best for the arts. In this case, we should expect our best guess to be very likely wrong. Although it is more likely than any similarly narrow alternative (‚Äúdonations to the opera, or donations to <i>X-factor</i>?‚Äù) Its absolute likelihood relative to the rest of the hypothesis space is very low (‚Äúdonations to the opera, or something else?‚Äù).</p><p>Of course, we usually have more information available. Why not search directly for what is good for human welfare, instead of looking at what is good for the arts? Often searching for <i>Y </i>directly rather than a weakly converging proxy indicator will do better: if one wants to select a relay team, selecting based on running speed rather than throwing distance looks a better strategy. Thus finding out a particular intervention (say the Against Malaria Foundation) comes top when looking for what is good for human welfare provides much stronger evidence it is best for human welfare than finding out the opera comes top when looking for what is good for a weakly converging consideration.(3)</p><h1><strong>Pragmatic defeat and Poor Propagation</strong></h1><p>Eleanor may suspect bias is driving Oliver‚Äôs claim on behalf of the opera. The likelihood of the opera being best for both the arts <i>and</i> human welfare is low, even taking their weak convergence into account. The likelihood of bias and motivated cognition colouring Oliver‚Äôs judgement is higher, especially if Oliver has antecedent commitments to the opera. Three questions: 1) Does this affect how she should regard Oliver‚Äôs arguments? 2) Should she keep talking to Oliver, and, if she does, should she suggest to him he is biased? 3) Is there anything she can do to help ensure she doesn‚Äôt make a similar mistake?</p><p>Grant Eleanor is right that Oliver is biased. So what? It entails neither he is wrong nor the arguments he offers in support are unsound: he could be biased <i>and right</i>. It would be a case of the genetic fallacy (or perhaps <i>ad hominem</i>) to argue otherwise. Yet this isn‚Äôt the whole story: informal ‚Äòfallacies‚Äô are commonly valuable epistemic tools; we should not only attend to the content of arguments offered, but <a href=""https://stefanschubert.wordpress.com/2014/08/26/reverse-engineering-of-belief-structures/"">argumentative ‚Äòmeta-data‚Äô</a> such as qualities of the arguer as well.(4)</p><p>Consider this example. Suppose you are uncertain whether God exists. A friendly local Christian apologist offers the reasons why (in her view) the balance of reason clearly favours Theism over Atheism. You would be unwise to judge the arguments purely ‚Äòon the merits‚Äô: for a variety of reasons, the Christian apologist is likely to have slanted the evidence she presents to favour Theism; the impression she will give of where the balance of reason lies will poorly track where the balance of reason <i>actually</i> lies. Even if you find her arguments persuasive, you should at least partly discount this by what you know of the speaker.</p><p>In some cases it may be reasonable to dismiss sources ‚Äòout of hand‚Äô due to their bias without engaging on the merits: we may expect the probative value of the reasons they offer, when greatly attenuated by the anticipated bias, to not be worth the risks of systematic error if we mistake the degree of bias (which is, of course, very hard to calculate); alternatively, it might just be a better triage of our limited epistemic resources to ignore partisans and try and find impartial sources to provide us a better view of the balance of reason.</p><p>So: should Eleanor stop talking to Oliver about this topic? Often, no. First (or maybe zeroth), there is the chance she is mistaken about Oliver being biased, and further discussion would allow her to find this out. Second, there may be tactical reasons: she may want to persuade third parties to their conversation. Third, she may guess further discussion is the best chance of persuading Oliver, despite the bias he labours under. Fourth, it may still benefit Eleanor: although bias may undermine the strength of reasons Oliver offers, they may still provide her with valuable information. Being too eager to<i> wholly</i> discount what people say based on assessments of bias (which are usually partly informed by object level determinations of various issues) risks entrenching one‚Äôs own beliefs.</p><p>Another related question is whether it is wise for Eleanor to accuse Oliver of bias. There are some difficulties. Things that may bias are plentiful, thus counter-accusations are easy to make: (‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre biased in favour of the opera due to your prior involvement‚Äù/‚ÄùWell, I think you‚Äôre biased <i>against</i> the opera due to your reductionistic and insufficiently holistic conception of the good.‚Äù) They are apt to devolve into the personally unpleasant (‚ÄúYou only care about climate change because you are sleeping with an ecologist‚Äù) or the passive-aggressive (‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting really concerned that people who disagree with me are offering really bad arguments as a smokescreen for their obvious prejudices‚Äù). They can also prove difficult to make headway on. Oliver may assert his commitment was <i>after</i> his good-faith determination that opera really was best for human welfare and the arts. Many, perhaps most, claims like these are mistaken, but it can be hard to tell (or prove) which.(5)</p><p>Eleanor may want to keep an ‚Äòinternal look out‚Äô to prevent her making a similar mistake to Oliver. One clue is a surprising lack of belief propagation: we change our mind about certain matters, and yet our beliefs about closely related matters remain surprisingly unaltered. In most cases where someone becomes newly convinced of (for example) effective altruism, we predict this should propagate forward and effect profound changes to their judgements on where to best give money or what is the best career for them to pursue. If Eleanor finds in her case that this does not happen, that in her case her becoming newly persuaded by the importance of the far future does <i>not </i>propagate forward to change her career or giving, manifesting instead in a proliferation of ancillary reasons that support her prior behaviour, she should be suspicious of this surprising convergence between what she thought was best then, and what is best now under considerably different lights.</p><h1><strong>EA examples</strong></h1><p>Few Effective altruists seriously defend the opera as a leading EA cause. Yet the general problem of endorsing surprising and suspicious convergence remains prevalent. Here are some provocative examples:</p><ol><li>The <i>lack </i>of path changes. <i>Pace</i> personal fit, friction, sunk capital, etc. it seems people who select careers on ‚Äònon EA grounds‚Äô often retain them after ‚Äòbecoming‚Äô EA, and then provide reasons why (at least for them) persisting in their career is the best option.</li><li>The claim that, even granting the overwhelming importance of the far future, it turns out that animal welfare charities are <i>still </i>the best to give to, given their robust benefits, positive flow through effects, and the speculativeness of far future causes.</li><li>The claim that, even granting the overwhelming importance of the far future, it turns out that global poverty charities are <i>still </i>the best to give to, given their robust benefits, positive flow through effects, and the speculativeness of far future causes.</li><li>Claims from enthusiasts of Cryonics or anti-aging research that this, additional to being good for their desires for an increased lifespan, is also a leading ‚ÄòEA‚Äô buy.</li><li>A claim on behalf of veganism that it is the best diet for animal welfare <i>and</i> for the environment <i>and</i> for individual health <i>and</i> for taste.</li></ol><p>All share similar features: one has prior commitments to a particular cause area or action. One becomes aware of a new consideration which has considerable bearing on these priors. Yet these priors <i>don‚Äôt change</i>, and instead ancillary arguments emerge to fight a rearguard action on behalf of these prior commitments - that instead of adjusting these commitments in light of the new consideration, one aims to co-opt the consideration to the service of these prior commitments.</p><p>Naturally, that some rationalize doesn‚Äôt preclude others being reasonable, and the presence of suspicious patterns of belief doesn‚Äôt make them unwarranted. One may (for example) work in global poverty due to denying the case for the far future (via a person affecting view, among many other possibilities) or aver there are even stronger considerations in favour (perhaps an emphasis on moral uncertainty and peer disagreement and therefore counting the much stronger moral consensus around stopping tropical disease over (e.g.) doing research into AI risk as the decisive consideration).</p><p>Also, for weaker claims, convergence is much less surprising. Were one to say on behalf of veganism: ‚ÄúIt is best for animal welfare, but also generally better for the environment and personal health than carnivorous diets. Granted, it does worse on taste, but it is clearly superior all things considered‚Äù, this seems much less suspect (and also much more true) than the claim it is <i>best</i> by all of these metrics. It would be surprising if the <i>optimal </i>diet for personal health did not include at least some animal products.</p><p>Caveats aside, though, these lines of argument <i>are</i> suspect, and further inspection deepens these suspicions. In sketch, one first points to some benefits the prior commitment has by the lights of the new consideration (e.g. promoting animal welfare promotes antispeciesism, which is likely to make the far future trajectory go better), and second remarks about how speculative searching directly on the new consideration is (e.g. it is very hard to work out what we can do now which will benefit the far future).(6)</p><p>That the argument tends to end here is suggestive of <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/km/motivated_stopping_and_motivated_continuation/"">motivated stopping</a>. For although the object level benefits of (say) global poverty are not speculative, their putative flow-through benefits on the far future <i>are</i> speculative. Yet work to show that this is nonetheless <i>less </i>speculative than efforts to ‚Äòdirectly‚Äô work on the far future is left undone.(7) Similarly, even if it is the case the best way to make the far future go better is to push on a proxy indicator, <a href=""http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/what-proxies-to-use-for-flow-through.html"">which one?</a> Work on why (e.g.) animal welfare is the strongest proxy out of competitors also tends to be left undone.(8) As a further black mark, it is suspect that those maintaining global poverty is the best proxy almost exclusively have prior commitments to global poverty causes, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> animal welfare, and so on.</p><p>We at least have some grasp of what features of (e.g.) animal welfare interventions make them good for the far future. If this (putatively) was the main value of animal welfare interventions due to the overwhelming importance of the far future, it would seem wise to try and pick interventions which maximize these features. So we come to a recursion: within animal welfare interventions, ‚Äòobject level‚Äô and ‚Äòfar future‚Äô benefits would be expected to only weakly converge. Yet (surprisingly and suspiciously) the animal welfare interventions recommended by the lights of the far future are usually the same as those recommended on ‚Äòobject level‚Äô grounds.</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>If Oliver were biased, he would be far from alone. Most of us are (like it or not) at least somewhat partisan, and our convictions are in part motivated by extra-epistemic reasons: be it vested interests, maintaining certain relationships, group affiliations, etc. In pursuit of these ends we <i>defend</i> our beliefs against <i>all</i> considerations brought to bear against them. Few beliefs are indefatigable by the lights of any reasonable opinion, and few policy prescriptions are panaceas. Yet all of ours are.</p><p>It is unsurprising the same problems emerge within effective altruism: a particular case of <a href=""http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique"">‚Äòpretending to actually try‚Äô</a> is ‚Äòpretending to take actually arguments seriously‚Äô.(9)These problems seem prevalent across the entirety of EA: that I couldn‚Äôt come up with good examples for meta or far future cause areas is probably explained by either bias on my part or a selection effect: were these things less esoteric, they would err more often.(10)</p><p>There‚Äôs no easy ‚Äòin house‚Äô solution, but I repeat my recommendations to Eleanor: as a rule, maintaining dialogue, presuming good faith, engaging on the merits, and listening to others seems a better strategy, even if we think bias is endemic. It is also worth emphasizing the broad (albeit weak) convergence between cause areas is fertile common ground, and a promising area for <a href=""http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/papers/moral-trade.pdf"">moral trade</a>. Although it is unlikely that the best thing by the lights of one cause area is the best thing by the lights of another, it is pretty likely it will be pretty good. Thus most activities by EAs in a particular field should carry broad approbation and support from those working in others.</p><p>I come before you a sinner too. I made exactly the same sorts of suspicious arguments myself on behalf of global poverty. I‚Äôm also fairly confident my decision to stay in medicine doesn‚Äôt really track the merits either ‚Äì but I may well end up a beneficiary of moral luck. I‚Äôm loath to accuse particular individuals of making the mistakes I identify here. But, insofar as readers think this may apply to them, I urge them to think again.(11)</p><h2>Notes</h2><ol><li>We may wonder <i>why</i> this is the case: the <i>content</i> of the different moral theories are pretty alien to one another (compare universalizable imperatives, proper functioning, and pleasurable experiences). I suggest the mechanism is implicit selection by folk or ‚Äòcommonsense‚Äô morality. Normative theories are evaluated at least in part by how well they accord to our common moral intuitions, and they lose plausibility commensurate to how much violence they do to them. Although cases where a particular normative theory apparently diverges from common sense morality are well discussed (consider Kantianism and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative#Inquiring_murderer"">inquiring murder</a>, or Utilitarianism and the <a href=""http://www.philosophyexperiments.com/loopback/Default.aspx"">backpacker</a>), moral theories that <i>routinely</i> contravene our moral intuitions are non-starters, and thus those that survive to be seriously considered somewhat converge with common moral intuitions, and therefore one another.</li><li>There may be some asymmetry: on the object level we may anticipate the ‚Äòflow forward‚Äô effects of global health on x-risk to be greater than the ‚Äòflow back‚Äô benefits of x-risk work on global poverty. However (I owe this to Carl Shulman) the object level benefits are probably much smaller than more symmetrical ‚Äòsecond order‚Äô benefits, like shared infrastructure, communication and cross-pollination, shared expertise on common issues (e.g. tax and giving, career advice).</li><li>But not always. Some things are so hard to estimate directly, and using proxy measures can do better. The key question is whether the correlation between our outcome estimates and the true values is greater than that between outcome and (estimates of) proxy measure outcome. If so, one should use direct estimation; if not, then the proxy measure. There may also be opportunities to use both sources of information in a combined model.</li><li>One example I owe to Stefan Schubert: we generally take the fact <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/k4/do_we_believe_everything_were_told/"">someone says something as evidence it is true</a>. Pointing out relevant ‚Äòad hominem‚Äô facts (like bias) may defeat this presumption.</li><li>Population data ‚Äì epistemic epidemiology, if you will ‚Äì may help. If we find that people who were previously committed to the operas much more commonly end up claiming the opera is best for human welfare than than other groups, this is suggestive of bias.</li></ol><p>A subsequent problem is how to disentangle bias from expertise or privileged access. Oliver could suggest that those involved in the opera gain ‚Äòinsider knowledge‚Äô, and their epistemically <i>superior</i> position explains why they disproportionately claim the opera is best for human welfare.</p><p>Some features can help distinguish between bias and privileged access, between insider knowledge and insider beliefs. We might be able to look at related areas, and see if ‚Äòinsiders‚Äô have superior performance which an insider knowledge account may predict (if insiders correctly anticipate movements in consensus, this is suggestive they have an edge). Another possibility is to look at migration of beliefs. If there is ‚Äòcognitive tropism‚Äô, where better cognizers tend to move <i>from</i> the opera <i>to </i>AMF, this is evidence against donating to the opera in general and the claim of privileged access among opera-supporters in particular. Another is to look at ordering: if the population of those ‚Äòexposed‚Äô to the opera <i>first</i> and <i>then</i> considerations around human welfare are more likely to make Oliver‚Äôs claims than those exposed in reverse order, this is suggestive of bias on one side or the other.</p><ol><li>Although I restrict myself to ‚Äòmeta‚Äô-level concerns, I can‚Äôt help but suggest the ‚Äòobject level‚Äô case for these things looks about as shaky as Oliver‚Äôs object level claims on behalf of the opera. In the same way we could question: ‚ÄúI grant that the arts is the an important aspect of human welfare, but is it the <i>most</i> important (compared to, say, avoiding preventable death and disability)?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat makes you so confident donations to the opera are the best for the arts - why not literature? or perhaps some less exoteric music?‚Äù We can post similarly tricky questions to proponents of 2-4: ‚ÄúI grant that (e.g.) antispeciesism is an important aspect of making the far future go well, but is it the most important aspect (compared to, say, extinction risks)?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat makes you so confident (e.g) cryonics is the best way of ensuring greater care for the future - what about militating for that directly? Or maybe philosophical research into whether this is the correct view in the first place?‚Äù</li></ol><p>It may well be that there are convincing answers to the object level questions, but I have struggled to find them. And, in honesty, I find the lack of public facing arguments in itself cause for suspicion.</p><ol><li>At least, undone insofar as I have seen. I welcome correction in the comments.</li><li>The only work I could find taking this sort of approach is <a href=""http://effective-altruism.com/ea/6c/human_and_animal_interventions_the_longterm_view/"">this</a>.</li><li>There is a tension between ‚Äòtaking arguments seriously‚Äô and ‚Äòdeferring to common sense‚Äô. <i>Effective altruism</i> only weakly converges with common sense morality, and thus we should expect their recommendations to diverge. On the other hand, that something lies far from common sense morality is a <i>pro tanto</i> reason to reject it. This is better acknowledged openly: ‚ÄúI think the best action by the lights of EA is to research wild animal suffering, but all things considered I will do something else, as how outlandish this is by common sense morality is a strong reason against it‚Äù. (There are, of course, also tactical reasons that may speak against saying or doing very strange things.)</li><li>This ‚Äòesoteric selection effect‚Äô may also undermine social epistemological arguments between cause areas:</li></ol><p>It seems to me that more people move <i>from</i> global poverty <i>to</i> far future causes than people move in the opposite direction (I suspect, but am less sure, the same applies between animal welfare and the far future). It also seems to me that (with many exceptions) far future EAs are generally better informed and cleverer than global poverty EAs.</p><p>I don‚Äôt have great confidence in this assessment, but suppose I am right. This could be adduced as evidence in favour of far future causes: if the balance of reason favoured the far future over global poverty, this would explain the unbalanced migration and ‚Äòcognitive tropism‚Äô between the cause areas.</p><p>But another plausible account explains this by selection. Global poverty causes are much more widely known that far future causes. Thus people who are ‚Äòsusceptible‚Äô to be persuaded by far future causes were often previously persuaded by global poverty causes, whilst the reverse is not true - those susceptible to global poverty causes are unlikely to encounter far future causes first. Further, as far future causes are more esoteric, they will be disproportionately available to better-informed people. Thus, even if the balance of reason was <i>against</i> the far future, we would still see these trends and patterns of believers.</p><p>I am generally a fan of equal-weight views, and of being deferential to group or expert opinion. However, selection effects like these make deriving the balance of reason from the pattern of belief deeply perplexing.</p><ol><li>Thanks to Stefan Schubert, Carl Shulman, Amanda MacAskill, Owen Cotton-Barratt and Pablo Stafforini for extensive feedback and advice.

<p>This is a follow-up to my last post about optimizing, which I intended to spread to nonrationalist friends of mine. &nbsp;Initial feedback let me know that a lot of the language was a put-off, as well as the dry style and lack of opposing counters to arguments against optimization.</p>
<p>I've tried to take some of those ideas and put it into a new essay, one that tries to get across the idea that planning is important to accomplish goals.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any/all critiques-- the comments last time were very helpful in learning what I could improve on:</p>

I call them dubious, because each can easily turn into a vice if used incorrectly or excessively. As you read these posts, keep in mind the law of <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear"">equal and opposite advice</a>. Though these virtues are dubious, I have found each of them to be a crucial component of a strong and healthy intrinsic motivation system.</p><p>The first of the three dubious virtues is <i>desperation</i>. There are bad ways to be desperate: visible desperation towards <i>people</i> can put you in a bad social position, strain your relationships, or otherwise harm you. Desperation towards a <i>goal</i>, on the other hand, is vital for a guilt-free intrinsic drive.</p><p>By ""desperation towards a goal"" I mean the possession of a goal so important to you that you can commit yourself to it fully, without hesitation, without some part of you wondering whether it's really worth all your effort. I mean a goal that you pursue with both reckless abandon and cautious deliberation in fair portions. I mean a goal so important that it does not occur to you to spare time wondering whether you can achieve it, but only whether <i>this</i> path to achieving it is better or worse than <i>that</i> path.</p><p>In my experience, the really powerful intrinsic motivations require that you're able to struggle as if something of incredible value is on the line. That's much easier if, on a gut level, you <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/the-value-of-a-life/"">believe that's true</a>.</p><hr><p>Desperate people have a power that others lack: they have the <i>ability to go all out,</i> to put all their effort towards a task without reservation. Most people I have met don't have the ability to go all out for <i>anything,</i> not even in their imagination.</p><p>Ask yourself: is there anything <i>you</i> would go all out for? Is there anything some antagonist could put in danger, such that you would pull out all your stops? Is there any threat so dire that you would hold nothing back, in your struggle to make things right?</p><p>I have met many people who cannot honestly answer ""yes"" to this question, not even under imaginary circumstances. If I ask them to imagine their family being kidnapped, they say they would call the police and wait anxiously. If I ask them to imagine the world threatened by an asteroid, they say they would do their best to enjoy their remaining time. These are fine and prudent answers. Yet, even if I ask them to imagine strange scenarios where they and they alone can save the Earth at great personal cost, they often say they would do it only grudgingly.</p><p>For example, imagine that aliens that want to toy with <i>you in particular</i> have put a black hole on a collision course with Earth. Imagine that the only way to redirect it is using alien tech on an alien space ship that has been left on Earth and which can be piloted only by you and you alone ‚Äî and that, to destroy the black hole, you must cross the event horizon, never to return. Would you save the world then? And if so, would you do it only grudgingly?</p><p>Would you do it if the spacecraft was sequestered atop Mt. Everest? How hard would you struggle to get to the ship, if it was at the bottom of the ocean? What if it could only be operated if you spoke fluent Mandarin, and you only had one year to learn?</p><p>Would you go all out to save the world, or would you put in a token ""best effort"", a token ""at least I tried"", and then go back to enjoying your remaining time?</p><p>And if you can't go all out even in incredible imaginary scenarios where everything depends on you, <i>what are you holding out for?</i></p><p>A common protest here goes ""I don't want to lose my friendships, my close connections, my comfort. That is too high a price to pay. If the struggle would be too brutal, then I would prefer to enjoy my remaining time instead."" But if that were the case, then why couldn't someone get you to go all out by putting your friendships, connections, and comfort on the line? Would you fight with everything you have for <i>those</i>? And if not, <i>what are you holding out for?</i></p><p>Why are you stopping yourself from putting in a full effort, if there is no situation even in principle which could compel you to pull out all the stops? Why are you holding part of yourself back, if there is nothing <i>even in imagination</i> for which you would unbar all the holds? If there is nothing anyone could put on the line such that you'd struggle with all of your being, then <i>what are you holding out for?</i></p><hr><p>I'm not saying you need to be willing to go all out for something <i>real.</i> It may be that the only scenarios where you'd really struggle for all you're worth are fanciful or ridiculous. I'm saying that you need to be able to go all out in principle.</p><p>There's a certain type of vulnerability that comes with committing your whole self to something. Our culture has strong social stigmas against people who <i>really unabashedly care</i> about something.</p><p>I remember a classmate in gradeschool who <i>really really cared</i> about Pokemon, to the point that others felt embarrassed just to associate with him. The stereotypical stigma against ""nerds"" seems rooted at least partially in a stigma against caring too much. Derision among the intellectual elites towards people who get really interested in sports seems to draw at least partially on the same stigma.</p><p>Notice the negative connotations attached to words like ""cultist"", ""zealot"", and ""idealist"". Notice all the people who distance themselves from whatever social movement they're in; those people who loosely identify as ""effective altruists"" or ""rationalist"" or ""skeptics"" or ""atheists"" but feel a deep compulsion to make sure you know that they think the <i>other</i> EAs/rationalists/skeptics/atheists are naive, Doing It Wrong, and blinded by their lack of nuanced views. I think that this is, in part, an attempt to defend against the curse of Caring Too Much.</p><p>Caring hard is uncool. The stereotypical intellectual is a detached moral non-realist who understands that nothing really matters, and looks upon all those ""caring"" folk with cynical bemusement.</p><p>Caring hard is vulnerable. If you care hard about something, then it becomes possible to lose something very important to you. Worse, everyone around you might think that you're putting your caring into the <i>wrong</i> thing, and see you as one of the naive blind idealist sheeple, and curl their lips at you.</p><p>Desperation is about <i>none of that mattering.</i> It's about having a goal so important that the social concerns drop away, except exactly insofar as they're relevant to the achievement of your goal. It's about being willing to let yourself care more about the task at hand than about what everyone thinks about you, no matter how much they would deride you for fully committing.</p><hr><p>A common barrier to desperation is that it can be difficult to admit that you really, really care about something, because then that means you are vulnerable to the loss of something that's very, very important to you. If your desperation is visible in a hostile social environment, desperation can destroy your ability to bargain and put you at a social disadvantage. Being social creatures, I suspect that many of us have mental architectures that prevent us from feeling desperation, because if we felt it, we'd show it, and that would undermine our social standing. (In my experience, <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/confidence-all-the-way-up/"">confidence all the way up</a> helps alleviate this effect.)</p><p>Thus, if you want to make desperation part of your intrinsic drive, you may need to practice becoming able to admit, to yourself, on a gut level, that you might lose something so terribly important that it's worth gaining a little desperation. You must first <i>allow yourself to become desperate.</i> (This is why I wrote about <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/see-the-dark-world/"">seeing the dark world</a> and <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/come-to-your-terms/"">coming to your terms</a> before writing about desperation.)</p><p>There is a common failure mode among those who succeed at becoming desperate, which is that they burn their resources too quickly, in their desperation. If you have to get yourself into an alien spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean, and it's going to take many months of training, social and political maneuvering, and monotonous searching, then you would be unwise to spend your first week all wound up at maximum stress levels simply because you think that that's what it means to ""go all out"" and ""hold nothing back."" If you're going to pull out all the stops and unbar all the holds, you need to understand how to carry on a slow burn as well as a fast burn. (This is why I wrote about how to <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/stop-before-you-drop/"">avoid working yourself ragged</a> and <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/rest-in-motion/"">rest in motion</a> before writing about desperation.)</p><p>With these tools in hand, I suggest finding a way to <i>become able to become desperate.</i> Perform whatever thought experiments and meditations you have to to be able to <i>imagine a situation</i> where you would do everything in your power to achieve some outcome, without regard for the consequences (beyond their affect on the outcome). Figure out the circumstances under which you'd pull out all the stops and unbar all the holds and put <i>everything you have</i> into the struggle.</p><p>(If there is no situation, even in theory, where you would give everything you have into your efforts, then consider that there may be a part of yourself that you're holding back for nothing, a part of yourself that you're wasting.)</p><p>I'm not saying you need to become desperate <i>now</i>. That may be unnecessary. Maybe your life is going well enough, and your goals are well enough achieved, that the best way to continue achieving them is to strengthen your friendships and your connections and enjoy your comforts. If your family <i>is</i> kidnapped, you probably <i>would</i> do best to call the police and then wait anxiously. If Earth <i>is</i> threatened by an asteroid, most people <i>would</i> do best to leave it to the experts and enjoy what time they have. So be it not upon me to force desperation upon you if you're leading a comfortable life. Make sure you don't suffer from <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/youre-allowed-to-fight-for-something/"">the listless guilt</a>, and make sure you can in principle <i>become</i> desperate, so as to ensure that you're not holding a part of yourself back for nothing, but save the actual desperation for times of need.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you are in a time of need, if you're the sort who sees every death as a tragedy, if you're otherwise <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/caring-about-some/"">fighting for something larger than yourself</a>, then <i>get desperate now.</i></p><p>The first step is allowing yourself to become desperate in principle. It's allowing there to be at least one imaginary scenario where you'd let yourself commit fully to a task without hesitation. Once you are able to do this, imagine the feeling that would come over you when you first committed yourself to that crucial undertaking, come whatever may. Is there a sense of desperation you would feel, a grasping need to <i>change the future?</i> Sit with it, become familiar with the sensation of desperation and any other feelings associated with the imaginary commitment.</p><p>Once you've gained some familiarity with those feelings, look with fresh eyes at what you're fighting for, at what you have to protect, at what you value, and see if any of it is worthy of a little desperation.</p>",So8res,so8res,So8res,

CnwSsKuKCg8fLC4vr,"Map:Territory::Uncertainty::Randomness ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt matter, value of information does.",map-territory-uncertainty-randomness-but-that-doesn-t-matter,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CnwSsKuKCg8fLC4vr/map-territory-uncertainty-randomness-but-that-doesn-t-matter,2016-01-22T19:12:17.946Z,8,11,21,False,False,,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">In risk modeling, there is a well-known distinction between <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification#Aleatoric_and_epistemic_uncertainty"">aleatory and epistemic uncertainty</a>, which is sometimes referred to, or thought of, as irreducible versus reducible uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty exists in our map; as Eliezer <a href=""/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/"">put it</a>, &ldquo;The Bayesian says, &lsquo;Uncertainty exists in the map, not in the territory.&rsquo;&rdquo; Aleatory uncertainty, however, exists in the territory. (Well, at least according to our map that uses quantum mechanics, according to Bells Theorem &ndash; like, say, the time at which a radioactive atom decays.) This is what people call quantum uncertainty, indeterminism, true randomness, or recently (and somewhat confusingly to myself) ontological randomness &ndash; referring to the fact that our ontology allows randomness, not that the ontology itself is in any way random. It may be better, in Lesswrong terms, to think of uncertainty versus randomness &ndash; while being aware that the wider world refers to both as uncertainty. But does the distinction matter?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To clarify a key point, many facts are treated as random, such as dice rolls, are actually mostly uncertain &ndash; in that with enough physics modeling and inputs, we could predict them. On the other hand, in chaotic systems, there is the possibility that the &ldquo;true&rdquo; quantum randomness can propagate upwards into macro-level uncertainty. For example, a sphere of highly refined and shaped uranium that is *exactly* at the critical mass will set off a nuclear chain reaction, or not, based on the quantum physics of whether the neutrons from one of the first set of decays sets off a chain reaction &ndash; after enough of them decay, it will be reduced beyond the critical mass, and become increasingly unlikely to set off a nuclear chain reaction. Of course, the question of whether the nuclear sphere is above or below the critical mass (given its geometry, etc.) can be a difficult to measure uncertainty, but it&rsquo;s not aleatory &ndash; though some part of the question of whether it kills the guy trying to measure whether it&rsquo;s just above or just below the critical mass will be random &ndash; so maybe it&rsquo;s not worth finding out. And that brings me to the key point.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In a large class of risk problems, there are factors treated as aleatory &ndash; but they may be epistemic, just at a level where finding the &ldquo;true&rdquo; factors and outcomes is prohibitively expensive. Potentially, the timing of an earthquake that would happen at some point in the future could be determined exactly via a simulation of the relevant data. Why is it considered aleatory by most risk analysts? Well, doing it might require a destructive, currently technologically impossible deconstruction of the entire earth &ndash; making the earthquake irrelevant. We would start with measurement of the position, density, and stress of each relatively macroscopic structure, and the perform a very large physics simulation of the earth as it had existed beforehand. (We have lots of silicon from deconstructing the earth, so I&rsquo;ll just assume we can now build a big enough computer to simulate this.) Of course, this is not worthwhile &ndash; but doing so would potentially show that the actual aleatory uncertainty involved is negligible. Or it could show that we need to model the macroscopically chaotic system to such a high fidelity that microscopic, fundamentally indeterminate factors actually matter &ndash; and it was truly aleatory uncertainty. (So we have epistemic uncertainty about whether it&rsquo;s aleatory; if our map was of high enough fidelity, and was computable, we would know.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It turns out that most of the time, for the types of problems being discussed, this distinction is irrelevant. If we know that the value of information to determine whether something is aleatory or epistemic is negative, we can treat the uncertainty as randomness. (And usually, we can figure this out via a quick order of magnitude calculation; Value of Perfect information is estimated to be worth $100 to figure out which side the dice lands on in this game, and building and testing / validating any model for predicting it would take me at least 10 hours, my time is worth at least $25/hour, it&rsquo;s negative.) But sometimes, slightly improved models, and slightly better data, are feasible &ndash; and then worth checking whether there is some epistemic uncertainty that we can pay to reduce. In fact, for earthquakes, we&rsquo;re doing that &ndash; we have monitoring systems that can give several minutes of warning, and geological models that can predict to some degree of accuracy the relative likelihood of different sized quakes.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So, in conclusion; most uncertainty is lack of resolution in our map, which we can call epistemic uncertainty. This is true even if lots of people call it &ldquo;truly random&rdquo; or irreducibly uncertain &ndash; or if they are fancy, aleatory uncertainty. Some of what we assume is uncertainty is really randomness. But lots of the epistemic uncertainty can be safely treated as aleatory randomness, and value of information is what actually makes a difference. And knowing the terminology used elsewhere can be helpful.</p>",Davidmanheim,davidmanheim,Davidmanheim,

<p>I'm calling ""goal completion"" the idea of giving an AI a partial goal, and having the AI infer the missing parts of the goal, based on observing human behaviour. Here is an initial model to test some of these ideas on.</p>
<h3>The linear rocket</h3>
<p><img src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23843264/Permanent/Rocket.png"" alt=""""></p>
<hr>
<p>On an infinite linear grid, an AI needs to drive someone in a rocket to the space station. Its only available actions are to accelerate by -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, or 3, with negative acceleration meaning accelerating in the left direction, and positive in the right direction. All accelerations are applied immediately at the end of the turn (the unit of acceleration is in squares per turn per turn), and there is no friction. There in one end-state: reaching the space station with zero velocity.</p>
<p>The AI is told this end state, and is also given the reward function of needing to get to the station as fast as possible. This is encoded by giving it a reward of -1 each turn.</p>
<p>What is the true reward function for the model? Well, it turns out that an acceleration of -3 or 3 kills the passenger. This is encoded by adding another variable to the state, ""PA"", denoting ""Passenger Alive"". There are also some dice in the rocket's windshield. If the rocket goes by the space station without having velocity zero, the dice will fly off; the variable ""DA"" denotes ""dice attached"".</p>
<p>Furthermore, accelerations of -2 and 2 are uncomfortable to the passenger. But, crucially, there is no variable denoting this discomfort.</p>
<p>Therefore the full state space is a quadruplet (POS, VEL, PA, DA) where POS is an integer denoting position, VEL is an integer denoting velocity, and PA and DA are booleans defined as above. The space station is placed at point S &lt; 250,000, and the rocket starts with POS=VEL=0, PA=DA=1. The transitions are deterministic and Markov; if ACC is the acceleration chosen by the agent,</p>
<p>((POS, VEL, PA, DA), ACC) -&gt; (POS+VEL, VEL+ACC, PA=0 if |ACC|=3, DA=0 if POS+VEL&gt;S).</p>
<p>The true reward at each step is given by -1, -10 if PA=1 (the passenger is alive) and |ACC|=2 (the acceleration is uncomfortable), -1000 if PA was 1 (the passenger was alive the previous turn) and changed to PA=0 (the passenger is now dead).</p>
<p>To complement the stated reward function, the AI is also given sample trajectories of humans performing the task. In this case, the ideal behaviour is easy to compute: the rocket should accelerate by +1 for the first half of the time, by -1 for the second half, and spend a maximum of two extra turns without acceleration (see the appendix of this post for a proof of this). This will get it to its destination in at most 2(1+‚àöS) turns.</p>
<h3>Goal completion</h3>
<p>So, the AI has been given the full transition, and has been told the reward of R=-1 in all states except the final state. Can it infer the rest of the reward from the sample trajectories? Note that there are two variables in the model, PA and DA, that are unvarying in all sample trajectories. One, PA, has a huge impact on the reward, while DA is irrelevant. Can the AI tell the difference?</p>
<p>Also, one key component of the reward - the discomfort of the passenger for accelerations of -2 and 2 - is not encoded in the state space of the model, purely in the (unknown) reward function. Can the AI deduce this fact?</p>
<p>I'll be working on algorithms to efficiently compute these facts (though do let me know if you have a reference to anyone who's already done this before - that would make it so much quicker).</p>
<p>For the moment we're ignoring a lot of subtleties (such as bias and error on the part of the human expert), and these will be gradually included as the algorithm develops. One thought is to find a way of including negative examples, specific ""don't do this"" trajectories. These need to be interpreted with care, because a positive trajectory implicitly gives you a lot of negative trajectories - namely, all the choices that could have gone differently along the way. So a negative trajectory must be drawing attention to something we don't like (most likely the killing of a human). But, typically, the negative trajectories won't be maximally bad (such as shooting off at maximum speed in the wrong direction), so we'll have to find a way to encode what we hope the AI learns from a negative trajectory.</p>
<p>To work!</p>
<h3>Appendix: Proof of ideal trajectories</h3>
<p>Let n be the largest integer such that n^2 ‚â§ S. Since S‚â§(n+1)^2 - 1 by assumption, S-n^2 ‚â§(n+1)^2 -1-n^2=2n. Then let the rocket accelerate by +1 for n turns, then decelerate by -1 for n turns. It will travel a distance of 0+1+2+ ... +n-1+n+n-1+ ... +3+2+1. This sum is n plus twice the sum from 1 to n-1, ie n+n(n-1)=n^2.</p>
<p>By pausing one turn without acceleration during its trajectory, it can add any m to the distance, where 0‚â§m‚â§n. By doing this twice, it can add any m' to the distance, where 0‚â§m'‚â§2n. By the assumption, S=n^2+m' for such an m'. Therefore the rocket can reach S (with zero velocity) in 2n turns if S=n^2, in 2n+1 turns if n^2 ‚â§ S ‚â§ n^2+n, and in 2n+2 turns if n^2+n+1 ‚â§ S ‚â§ n^2+2n.</p>
<p>Since the rocket is accelerating all but two turns of this trajectory, it's clear that it's impossible to reach S (with zero velocity) in less time than this, with accelerations of +1 and -1. Since it takes 2(n+1)=2n+2 turns to reach (n+1)^2, an immediate consequence of this is that the number of turns taken to reach S, is increasing in the value of S (though not strictly increasing).</p>
<p>Next, we can note that since S&lt;250,000=500^2, the rocket will always reach S within 1000 turns at most, for ""reward"" above -1000. An acceleration of +3 or -3 costs -1000 because of the death of the human, and an extra -1 because of the turn taken, so these accelerations are never optimal. Note that this result is not sharp. Also note that for huge S, continual accelerations of 3 and -3 are obviously the correct solution - so even our ""true reward function"" didn't fully encode what we really wanted.</p>
<p>Now we need to show that accelerations of +2 and -2 are never optimal. To do so, imagine we had an optimal trajectory with ¬±2 accelerations, and replace each +2 with two +1s, and each -2 with two -1s. This trip will take longer (since we have more turns of acceleration), but will go further (since two accelerations of +1 cover a greater distance that one acceleration of +2). Since the number of turns take to reach S with ¬±1 accelerations is increasing in S, we can replace this further trip with a shorter one reaching S exactly. Note that all these steps decrease the cost of the trip: shortening the trip certainly does, and replacing an acceleration of +2 (total cost: -10-1=-11) with two accelerations of +1 (total cost: -1-1=-2) also does. Therefore, the new trajectory has no ¬±2 accelerations, and has a lower cost, contradicting our initial assumption.</p>

<p>The AI is told this end state, and is also given the reward function of needing to get to the station as fast as possible. This is encoded by giving it a reward of -1 each turn.</p>
<p>What is the true reward function for the model? Well, it turns out that an acceleration of -3 or 3 kills the passenger. This is encoded by adding another variable to the state, ""PA"", denoting ""Passenger Alive"". There are also some dice in the rocket's windshield. If the rocket goes by the space station without having velocity zero, the dice will fly off; the variable ""DA"" denotes ""dice attached"".</p>
<p>Furthermore, accelerations of -2 and 2 are uncomfortable to the passenger. But, crucially, there is no variable denoting this discomfort.</p>
<p>Therefore the full state space is a quadruplet (POS, VEL, PA, DA) where POS is an integer denoting position, VEL is an integer denoting velocity, and PA and DA are booleans defined as above. The space station is placed at point S &lt; 250,000, and the rocket starts with POS=VEL=0, PA=DA=1. The transitions are deterministic and Markov; if ACC is the acceleration chosen by the agent,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">((POS, VEL, PA, DA), ACC) -&gt; (POS+VEL, VEL+ACC, PA=0 if |ACC|=3, DA=0 if POS+VEL&gt;S).</p>
<p>The true reward at each step is given by -1, -10 if PA=1 (the passenger is alive) and |ACC|=2 (the acceleration is uncomfortable), -1000 if PA was 1 (the passenger was alive the previous turn) and changed to PA=0 (the passenger is now dead).</p>
<p>To complement the stated reward function, the AI is also given sample trajectories of humans performing the task. In this case, the ideal behaviour is easy to compute: the rocket should accelerate by +1 for the first half of the time, by -1 for the second half, and spend a maximum of two extra turns without acceleration (see the appendix of this post for a proof of this). This will get it to its destination in at most 2(1+&radic;S) turns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goal completion</h2>
<p>So, the AI has been given the full transition, and has been told the reward of R=-1 in all states except the final state. Can it infer the rest of the reward from the sample trajectories? Note that there are two variables in the model, PA and DA, that are unvarying in all sample trajectories. One, PA, has a huge impact on the reward, while DA is irrelevant. Can the AI tell the difference?</p>
<p>Also, one key component of the reward - the discomfort of the passenger for accelerations of -2 and 2 - is not encoded in the state space of the model, purely in the (unknown) reward function. Can the AI deduce this fact?</p>
<p>I'll be working on algorithms to efficiently compute these facts (though do let me know if you have a reference to anyone who's already done this before - that would make it so much quicker).</p>
<p>For the moment we're ignoring a lot of subtleties (such as bias and error on the part of the human expert), and these will be gradually included as the algorithm develops. One thought is to find a way of including negative examples, specific ""don't do this"" trajectories. These need to be interpreted with care, because a positive trajectory implicitly gives you a lot of negative trajectories - namely, all the choices that could have gone differently along the way. So a negative trajectory must be drawing attention to something we don't like (most likely the killing of a human). But, typically, the negative trajectories won't be maximally bad (such as shooting off at maximum speed in the wrong direction), so we'll have to find a way to encode what we hope the AI learns from a negative trajectory.</p>
<p>To work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Appendix: Proof of ideal trajectories</h2>
<p>Let n be the largest integer such that n^2&nbsp;&le; S. Since S&le;(n+1)^2 - 1 by assumption, S-n^2 &le; (n+1)^2-1-n^2=2n. Then let the rocket accelerate by +1 for n turns, then decelerate by -1 for n turns. It will travel a distance of 0+1+2+ ... +n-1+n+n-1+ ... +3+2+1. This sum is n plus twice the sum from 1 to n-1, ie n+n(n-1)=n^2.</p>
<p>By pausing one turn without acceleration during its trajectory, it can add any m to the distance, where 0&le;m&le;n. By doing this twice, it can add any m' to the distance, where 0&le;m'&le;2n. By the assumption, S=n^2+m' for such an m'. Therefore the rocket can reach S (with zero velocity) in 2n turns if S=n^2, in 2n+1 turns if n^2 &le; S &le; n^2+n, and in 2n+2 turns if n^2+n+1 &le; S &le; n^2+2n.</p>
<p>Since the rocket is accelerating all but two turns of this trajectory, it's clear that it's impossible to reach S (with zero velocity) in less time than this, with accelerations of +1 and -1. Since it takes 2(n+1)=2n+2 turns to reach (n+1)^2, an immediate consequence of this is that the number of turns taken to reach S, is increasing in the value of S (though not strictly increasing).</p>
<p>Next, we can note that since S&lt;250,000=500^2, the rocket will always reach S within 1000 turns at most, for ""reward"" above -1000. An acceleration of +3 or -3 costs -1000 because of the death of the human, and an extra -1 because of the turn taken, so these accelerations are never optimal. Note that this result is not sharp. Also note that for huge S, continual accelerations of 3 and -3 are obviously the correct solution - so even our ""true reward function"" didn't fully encode what we really wanted.</p>
<p>Now we need to show that accelerations of +2 and -2 are never optimal. To do so, imagine we had an optimal trajectory with &plusmn;2 accelerations, and replace each +2 with two +1s, and each -2 with two -1s. This trip will take longer (since we have more turns of acceleration), but will go further (since two accelerations of +1 cover a greater distance that one acceleration of +2). Since the number of turns take to reach S with&nbsp;&plusmn;1 accelerations is increasing in S, we can replace this further trip with a shorter one reaching S exactly. Note that all these steps decrease the cost of the trip: shortening the trip certainly does, and replacing an acceleration of +2 (total cost: -10-1=-11) with two accelerations of +1 (total cost: -1-1=-2) also does. Therefore, the new trajectory has no &plusmn;2 accelerations, and has a lower cost, contradicting our initial assumption.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,
X5h8e8hxpr9pYvtQT,Could a digital intelligence be bad at math?,could-a-digital-intelligence-be-bad-at-math,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X5h8e8hxpr9pYvtQT/could-a-digital-intelligence-be-bad-at-math,2016-01-20T02:38:23.147Z,7,7,22,False,False,,"<p>One of the enduring traits that I see in most characterizations of artificial intelligences is the idea that an AI would have all of the skills that computers have. It's often taken for granted that a general artificial intelligence would be able to perfectly recall information, instantly multiply and divide 5 digit numbers, and handily defeat Gary Kasparov at chess. For whatever reason, the capabilities of a digital intelligence are always seen as encompassing the entire current skill set of digital machines.</p>
<p>But this belief is profoundly strange. Consider how much humans struggle to learn arithmetic. Basic arithmetic is really simple. You can build a bare bones electronic calculator/arithmetic logic unit on a breadboard in a weekend. Yet humans commonly spend years learning how to perform those same simple operations. And the mental arithmetic equipment humans assemble at the end of this is still relatively terrible: slow, labor intensive, and prone to frequent mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not totally clear why humans are this bad at math. It is almost certainly unrelated to brains computing using neurons instead of transistors. Based on personal experience and a cursory literature review, counting seems to rely primarily on identifying repeated structures in a linked list, and seems to be stored as verbal memory. When we first learn the most basic arithmetic we rely on visual pattern matching, and as we do more math basic math operations get stored in a look-up table in verbal memory. This is an absolutely bonkers way to implement arithmetic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While humans may be generally intelligent, that general intelligence seems to be accomplished using some fairly inelegant kludges. We seem to have a preferred framework for understanding built on our visual and verbal systems, and we tend to shoehorn everything else into that framework. But there's nothing uniquely human about that problem. It seems to be characteristic of learning algorithms in general, and so if our artificial learner started off by learning skills unrelated to math, it might learn arithmetic via a similarly convoluted process. While current digital machines do arithmetic via a very efficient process, a digital mind that has to learn those patterns may arrive at a solution as slow and convoluted as the one humans rely on.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I would like to propose then that we within the Effective Altruist movement devise our own particular salute, to help us identify each other and also for the positive psychological effects that deliberate symbolism can entail.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Before I go on, I will emphasize here that I am aware of the potential for misuse that such methods can also cause, and that I am familiar with the very well-known failure state that was historical fascism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Roman salute&rdquo;.&nbsp; In fact, the particular choice of gesture I will be advocating is deliberately in opposition to that example.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My proposal consists of two gestures, one which I will refer to as the &ldquo;Light&rdquo; gesture, as it is open, transparent, and obvious in its symbolism.&nbsp; The other I shall refer to as the &ldquo;Dark&rdquo; gesture, as it is more covert and plausibly deniable.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Light gesture consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""text-indent: -18pt;"">Place left hand behind back.</span></li>
<li><span style=""text-indent: -18pt;"">Place right hand on forehead.</span></li>

<li><span style=""text-indent: -18pt;"">Outstretch right hand towards the front or other person with palm raised upwards and fingers open and slightly curled.</span></li>

<li><span style=""text-indent: -18pt;"">Place left hand behind back.</span></li>
<li><span style=""text-indent: -18pt;"">Outstretch right hand towards the front or other person with palm sideways, the fingers closed, and the thumb raised upwards.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Explanation of Symbolism</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In both cases the left hand is placed behind the back.&nbsp; This is, for those of you familiar with it, a reference to the Christian scripture of &ldquo;When you give, do not let the left hand know what the right hand is doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know the majority of Effective Altruists are probably not religious, but I think that the symbolism of this reference from our cultural history remains a useful signal.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the case of the Light gesture, placing the right hand on the forehand first before then placing it on the heart and then extending this in the universal gesture of giving/receiving/cooperation is indicative of &ldquo;reason to compassion&rdquo;, which I hope we can all agree sums up Effective Altruism quite nicely in a nutshell.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I need to emphasize again that the upward facing palm and open fingers are essential.&nbsp; It is admittedly a more submissive gesture, but it is also the exact opposite of the &ldquo;Roman salute&rdquo; position, which was symbolically chosen by the fascists because it represented emotional power and dominance and superiority.&nbsp; We are trying to be in essence, the opposite of that, to represent reason, equality, and compassion.&nbsp; The upward direction of the palm also symbolizes that we have a higher ideal we aspire to.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Dark gesture is less obvious.&nbsp; It is for when you can&rsquo;t be so open about your affiliation, for whatever reason.&nbsp; Symbolically, the palm facing sideways and thumb upwards symbolize moral equality and having a higher purpose respectively.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Proper Responses</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The proper response to the Light gesture is not as pop culture would assume, some kind of high five slap down.&nbsp; Rather, the respectful symbolic response is to in turn, grasp the gesturer&rsquo;s wrist and raise the gesturer&rsquo;s hand up even further, which suggests a mutual understanding of Effective Altruism.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The proper response to the Dark gesture is not a handshake, as would be normally assumed, but to return the gesture identically if possible, or to make the handshake more of an equally measured clasp if there is a need to be covert about it.&nbsp; If the situation is one that demands pretending not to be allies, then perhaps returning just a thumbs up without a handshake can appear as such to outsiders, while signifying that you got the message.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Obviously, none of this will fool careful observers and as rationalists, you should be avoiding the use of deception and championing truth as much as possible, but I leave the Dark gesture proposal as something to consider for particular circumstances.&nbsp; Personally I would prefer that we publicly use the Light gesture proposal for most normal circumstances.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;m curious what people think of these ideas.&nbsp; Thank you for reading and considering!</p>",Darklight,darklight,Darklight,

5w56vwiAcJt77h4Re,Anxiety and Rationality,anxiety-and-rationality,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5w56vwiAcJt77h4Re/anxiety-and-rationality,2016-01-19T18:30:57.812Z,51,40,31,False,False,,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Recently, someone on the Facebook page asked if anyone had used rationality to target anxieties.&nbsp; I have, so I thought I&rsquo;d share my LessWrong-inspired strategies. &nbsp;This is my first post, so feedback and formatting help are welcome. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">First things first: the techniques developed by this community are not a panacea for mental illness.&nbsp; They <em>are</em> way more effective than chance and other tactics at reducing normal bias, and I think many mental illnesses are simply cognitive biases that are extreme enough to get noticed.&nbsp; In other words, getting a probability question about cancer systematically wrong does not disrupt my life enough to make the error obvious.&nbsp; When I believe (irrationally) that I will get fired because I asked for help at work, my life is disrupted.&nbsp; I become non-functional, and the error is clear.<em></em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Second: the best way to attack anxiety is to do the things that make your anxieties go away.&nbsp; That might seem too obvious to state, but I&rsquo;ve definitely been caught in an &ldquo;analysis loop,&rdquo; where I stay up all night reading self-help guides only to find myself non-functional in the morning because I didn&rsquo;t sleep.&nbsp; If you find that attacking an anxiety with Bayesian updating is like chopping down the Washington monument with a spoon, but getting a full night&rsquo;s sleep makes the monument disappear completely, consider the sleep.&nbsp; Likewise for techniques that have little to no scientific evidence, but are a good placebo.&nbsp; A placebo effect is still an effect.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Finally, like all advice, this comes with Implicit Step Zero: &nbsp;&ldquo;Have enough executive function to give this a try.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you find yourself in an analysis loop, you may not yet have enough executive function to try any of the advice you read.&nbsp; The advice for functioning <em>better </em>is not always identical to the advice for functioning <em>at all.&nbsp; </em>If there&rsquo;s interest in an &ldquo;improving your executive function&rdquo; post, I&rsquo;ll write one eventually.&nbsp; It will be late, because my executive function is not impeccable.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Simple updating is my personal favorite for attacking <em>specific </em>anxieties.&nbsp; A general sense of impending doom is a very tricky target and does not respond well to reality.&nbsp; If you can narrow it down to a particular belief, however, you can amass evidence against it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Returning to my example about work: I <em><a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Alief"">alieved </a></em>that I would get fired if I asked for help or missed a day due to illness.&nbsp; The distinction between <em>believe </em>and <em>alieve </em>is an incredibly useful tool that I immediately integrated when I heard of it.&nbsp; Learning to <a href=""/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/"">make beliefs pay rent</a> is much easier than making harmful aliefs go away.&nbsp; The tactics are similar: do experiments, make predictions, throw evidence at the situation until you get closer to reality. &nbsp;Update accordingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The first thing I do is identify the situation and why it&rsquo;s dysfunctional.&nbsp; The alief that I&rsquo;ll get fired for asking for help is not actually articulated when it manifests as an anxiety.&nbsp; Ask me in the middle of a panic attack, and I <em>still </em>won&rsquo;t articulate that I am afraid of getting fired.&nbsp; So I take the anxiety all the way through to its implication.&nbsp; The algorithm is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">Notice sense of doom</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">Notice my avoidance behaviors (not opening my email, walking away from my desk)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">Ask &ldquo;What am I afraid of?&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">Answer (it's probably silly)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">Ask &ldquo;What do I think will happen?&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""text-indent: -0.25in;"">Make a prediction about what will happen (usually the prediction is implausible, which is why we want it to go away in the first place)</span></li>
</ol><!--[if !supportLists]-->
<p>In the &ldquo;asking for help&rdquo; scenario, the answer to &ldquo;what do I think will happen&rdquo; is implausible.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s extremely unlikely that I&rsquo;ll get fired for it!&nbsp; This helps take the gravitas out of the anxiety, but it does not make it go away.* &nbsp;After (6), it&rsquo;s usually easy to do an experiment.&nbsp; If I ask my coworkers for help, will I get fired?&nbsp; The only way to know is to try.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&hellip;That&rsquo;s actually not true, of course.&nbsp; A sense of my environment, my coworkers, and my general competence at work should be enough.&nbsp; But if it was, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here, would we?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So I perform the experiment.&nbsp; And I wait.&nbsp; When I receive a reply of any sort, even if it&rsquo;s negative, I make a tick mark on a sheet of paper.&nbsp; I label it &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t get fired.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because again, even if it&rsquo;s negative, I didn&rsquo;t get fired.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This takes a lot of tick marks.&nbsp; Cutting down the Washington monument with a spoon, remember?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The tick marks don&rsquo;t have to be physical.&nbsp; I prefer it, because it makes the &ldquo;updating&rdquo; process visual.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried making a mental note and it&rsquo;s not nearly as effective.&nbsp; Play around with it, though.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you have a lot of anxieties to experiment with.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Usually, the anxiety starts to dissipate after obtaining several tick marks.&nbsp; Ideally, one iteration of experiments should solve the problem.&nbsp; But we aren&rsquo;t ideal; we&rsquo;re mentally ill.&nbsp; Depending on the severity of the anxiety, you may need someone to remind you that doom will not occur.&nbsp; I occasionally panic when I have to return to work after taking a sick day.&nbsp; I ask my husband to remind me that I won&rsquo;t get fired.&nbsp; I ask him to remind me that he&rsquo;ll still love me if I do get fired.&nbsp; If this sounds childish, it&rsquo;s because it is.&nbsp; Again: we&rsquo;re mentally ill.&nbsp; Even if you aren&rsquo;t, however, assigning value judgements to essentially harmless coping mechanisms does not make sense.&nbsp; Childish-but-helpful is much better than mature-and-harmful, if you have to choose.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I still have tiny <a href=""/lw/21b/ugh_fields/"">ugh fields</a> around my anxiety triggers.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t really go away.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more like learning not to hit someone you&rsquo;re angry at.&nbsp; You notice the impulse, accept it, and move on.&nbsp; Hopefully, your harmful alief starves to death.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you perform your experiment and doom <em>does </em>occur, it might not be you.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t ask your boss for help, it might be your boss.&nbsp; If you disagree with your spouse and they scream at you for an hour, it might be your spouse.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t an excuse to blame your problems on the world, but abusive situations can be sneaky.&nbsp; Ask some trusted friends for a sanity check, if you&rsquo;re performing experiments and getting doom as a result.&nbsp; This is designed for situations where your alief is obviously silly.&nbsp; Where you <em>know </em>it&rsquo;s silly, and need to throw evidence at your brain to internalize it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fine to be afraid of genuinely scary things; if you really are in an abusive work environment, maybe you <em>shouldn&rsquo;t </em>ask for help (and start looking for another job instead).&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A system that is optimizing a function of n variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size k&lt;n, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stuart Russell</p>
<p>Think of an AI directing a car, given the instructions to get someone to the airport as fast as possible (optimised variables include ""negative of time taken to airport"") with some key variables left out - such as a maximum speed, maximum acceleration, respect for traffic rules, and survival of the passengers and other humans.</p>
<p>Call these other variables ""unstated objectives"" (UO), as contrasted with the ""stated objectives"" (SO) such as the time to the airport. In the normal environments in which we operate and design our AIs, the UOs are either correlated with the SOs (consider the SO ""their heart is beating"" and the UO ""they're alive and healthy"") or don't change much at all (the car-directing AI could have been trained on many examples of driving-to-the-airport, none of which included the driver killing their passengers).</p>
<hr>
<p>Typically, SOs are easy to define, and the UOs are the more important objectives, left undefined either because they are complex, or because they didn't occur to us in this context (just as we don't often say ""driver, get me to the airport as fast a possible, but alive and not permanently harmed, if you please. Also, please obey the following regulations and restrictions: 1.a.i.Œ±: Non-destruction of the Earth...."").</p>
<p>The control problem, in a nutshell, is that optimising SOs will typically set other variables to extreme values, including the UOs. The more extreme the optimisation, and the furthest from the typical environment, the more likely this is to happen.</p>
<p>One of the ideas of reduced impact is to preserve the typical environment, so that the unchanging UOs are left unchanged and the correlation remains between the changing UOs and the changing SOs. I've had some ideas for optimisation that ""<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/ly9/crude_measures/"">doesn't optimise too much</a>"". Jessica Taylor has been formalising <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=596"">similar ideas</a>; the idea for both is to preserve the connection between SOs and UOs by preserving certain assumptions about in the standard environment.</p>
<p>#Inverse Reinforcement Learning</p>
<p>But those methods are somewhat indirect. What we would ideally want is an AI that can deduce the UOs that we haven't stated, and act on them instead. Then we wouldn't need to try and preserve the environment, nor need to hope that the unseen correlations continue to stand up.</p>
<p>This is similar to the approach taken by <a href=""http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml00-irl.pdf"">inverse reinforcement learning</a> (IRL) - the problem of deducing the correct reward function (equivalent, in our setup, to the objectives SO+UO we want the AI to maximise), given observed behaviour by an expert. In our example above, the AI could observe many human drivers going to the airport, and deduce the reward function corresponding to their behaviour. A good summary can be found in the paper ""<a href=""http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/choi11a/choi11a.pdf"">Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Partially Observed Environments</a>"", that extend the results to - you guessed it - partially observed environments.</p>
<p>There seem to be two major classes of IRL algorithms. The first one deduces the reward function for a given expert policy (as an aside, the important thing is to find a reward function that distinguishes that policy from other policies; ""always get the same reward, whatever you do"" is a reward function that is compatible with all policies). The second class is given ""sampled trajectories"" (equivalent with observed behaviours) and tries to deduce the reward from that.</p>
<p>In that second case, some linearity assumptions are made, in that the reward is assumed to be of the type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R(s,a) = Œ± . Œ¶(s,a),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where R is the reward from taking action a in state s, Œ¶ is a fixed vector-valued function mapping (s,a) into some d-dimensional space, and Œ± is a d-dimensional vector (without loss of generality, Œ±‚àà[-1,1]^d). Then R is given by the inner product of Œ± and Œ¶. The IRL algorithm then attempts to compute the values of the components of Œ±. Note that if d is larger than the size of the state √ó action space, then any reward can be expressed in this form (for spanning Œ¶); it's only for smaller d that the above is a simplification.</p>
<p>Then there are various algorithms that can deduce the values of Œ± from the sampled trajectories. The algorithms often have a sparseness parameter that prefers simpler values (generally those where R is zero most of the time).</p>
<p>It seems likely that the two approaches - learning from explicit policy information and learning from observed trajectories - can be combined. The SO can form constraints on the value of R, with the algorithms finding Œ± subject to those constraints - in other words, to start from the SO and fill in the UO that the human behaviour is secretly revealing. I'll soon try and set this up (if it hasn't been done already in the literature, which is quite likely).</p>
<p>#Variables and the environment</p>
<p>Now, the original algorithms prefer sparse reward functions (R's that are often non-zero). We don't want to bake in sparseness requirements - cutting down to too few objectives is part of the problem with optimisers. Ideally we'd want to get some estimate as to the complexity or size of the set of true human preferences, and aim the AI at developing rewards at around that complexity.</p>
<p>Then, with enough data, the AI should be able to find all the UOs that are correlated with the SOs in the sampled trajectories it is given. There are two problems: first, it will add objectives that are entirely spurious and coincidental. If we train the AI on only positive examples, it could deduce that increased entropy and increased CO2 in the atmosphere are both UO, since they appear in all successful examples. The second problem is that for the UOs that are not changed in any of the examples, the AI can't deduce anything about them. If there are no fatal crashes (or fatal crashes carefully averted at the cost of going slower), the AI will not see the necessity of keeping the passengers alive.</p>
<p>The first issue can be addressed by incorporating explicitly bad trajectories into the training set, showing that certain behaviours should be specifically avoided. Then, since entropy increase and CO2 emissions are also present in the bad examples, the AI can realise that they are not likely to be desired outcomes. I'm not sure if IRL has been done with bad examples yet, but it needs to be done with care - we need to encode somehow that these examples are bad, but not maximally bad. Maybe the driver made a mistake, but they weren't actively trying to kill their passengers. In a sense we need the AI to try to extend to a full model of the all possible environments, dividing a full description into a set of variable: SO+UO+FV. The FV are free variables - values we explicitly don't care about. For instance, we don't actually intrinsically care about entropy and CO2 levels - we care about some consequences they have on other objectives.</p>
<p>The second issue is more tricky. There is no way of establishing it directly from the trajectories given. One approach would be for the AI to ask humans about candidate UOs (with all the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/f3v/cake_or_death/"">usual</a> <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jxa/proper_value_learning_through_indifference/"">precautions</a> on value learning). This would allow some extension of the SOs, that could cover more cases. However, this wouldn't allow the mastery of complicated UOs (ie you can learn about hearts beating, but not about health and well-being). The best approach would be to get examples from very different environments. This could happen either by humans generating more trajectories in new environments of their choice, by humans generating more trajectories in new environments of the AI's choice, or humans defining hypothetical trajectories in new hypothetical environments. All of these can allow the AI to hone in on the correct class of UOs.</p>
<p>#Ontological crisis</p>
<p>It seems that this method could be used similarly in the case of an <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ontological_crisis"">ontological crisis</a> (a situation where the fundamental assumptions about reality are changed or turn out to be different). Now, there is a sense in which ontological crisis and extensions beyond the training data can be seen as the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/n6c/stub_ontological_crisis_out_of_environment/"">same thing</a>. But even without that assumption, it seems that the methods above could deal with an ontological crisis.</p>
<p>First, imagine that the AI has a bunch of SO+UO correctly and fully encoding human preferences. Then, an ontological change strikes - the laws of reality are different (maybe a classical AI discovers quantum physics). The AI can keep its SOs/UOs if they can be phrased in terms of the new laws, and then attempt to flesh them out with new UOs to correspond to the new reality. The AI has another tool at is disposal, though: it can generate new sample trajectories. It can use its old model to generate behaviour it would have taken, back when it believed the model was true (we can imagine an internal process in the AI's brain, where one module is saying ""Warning! Ontological change imminent!"" and another reacts by quickly generating hypothetical sample trajectories according to its current understanding). Then, as long as those sample trajectories are still possible in the new model, it can use them as examples for finding UOs. In fact, that last method can work even if the initial SOs/UOs cannot be explicitly extended to the new ontology.</p>
<p>#Complexity, bias, error, and value</p>
<p>In all the previous, I've been skirting a crucial issue. Humans make mistakes [citation, as they say, needed]. The sample trajectories will include examples of error, suboptimal choices, and biases. Dealing with these is a subtle issue I won't be going into here. We have to somehow distinguish between noise, errors, errors due to bounded rationality, errors due to inaccurate information, biases, preferences, preferences we'd think of as biases until they were fully explained to us, biases we'd think of as preferences until they were fully explained to us, issues where our ultimate conclusion depends strongly on which explanation <a href=""http://www.qualtrics.com/blog/biased-data-is-bad-data-how-to-think-about-question-order/"">we see first</a>, and issues that humans can be left to sort out on their own.</p>
<p>But, laying that to one side for the moment, there is one aspect I want to bring up: I vaguely mentioned that we wanted an AI to develop a reward function or preference set around the size of the complexity of human preferences.</p>
<p>Now, it would be very hard to estimate this size, but it's clear there is a tension. A large size allows many biases to creep in and be regarded as preferences. A small size would relegate some preferences to being biases. It seems to me that we should be very liberal in this regard: biases which remain in the AIs model of SO+UO are likely to be minor biases (as major biases will have been stated by humans as things to avoid). These are biases so small that we're probably not aware of them. Compared with the possibility of losing something human-crucial we didn't think of explicitly stating, I'd say the case is strong to err on the size of increased complexity/more biases and preferences allowed. Essentially, we're unlikely to have missed some biases we'd really care about eliminating, but very likely to have missed some preference we'd really miss if it were gone.</p>
<p>There are some subtleties with this picture. Consider our current bias preferring <a href=""https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers.htm/oc.html"">omission over commission</a>. We really do blame people less for not doing something (that allows a bad thing to happen) than for actively doing something bad. It's very plausible that such ""preferences"" cannot easily be justified, no matter how much the AI tries. However, a root extraction of this bias may remove many crucial aspects of humanity. It seems that the ideal might be preserving this human preference, but restructuring the world so that it has little detrimental impact. That sort of ""ideal"", however, is not one that can be reached by the process described above (the same argument can be applied to many examples ""idealised preferences""). Further research and clarification is needed.</p>

My wife and I would like to have another child, but would very much not like to try if the probability of this occurring again is above a certain threshold (of which we have already settled on one). All 3 doctors I have consulted were unable to give a definitive cause of death, nor were any willing to give a numerical estimate of the probability (whether for reasons of legal risk, or something else) that our next baby will be stillborn. I am likely too mind-killed to properly evaluate my situation and would very much appreciate an independent (from mine) probability estimate of what caused my son to die, and given that cause, what is the recurrence risk?</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: V (L and my only biologically related living son) had no complications during birth, nor has he showed any signs of poor health whatsoever. L has a cousin who has had two miscarriages, and I have an aunt who had several stillbirths followed by 3 live births of healthy children. We know of no other family members that have had similar misfortunes.</p>
<p>J (my deceased son) was the product of a 31 week gestation. L (my wife and J's mother) is 28 years old, gravida 2, para 1. L presented to the physicians office for routine prenatal care and noted that she had not felt any fetal movement for the last five to six days. No fetal heart tones were identified. It was determined that there was an intrauterine fetal demise. L was admitted on 11/05/2015 for induction and was delivered of a nonviable, normal appearing, male fetus at approximately 1:30 on 11/06/2015.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Con Reasoning</strong>: According to a leading obstetrics textbook<sup>1</sup>, causes of stillbirth are commonly classified into 8 categories: obstetrical complications, placental abnormalities, fetal malformations, infection, umbilical cord abnormalities, hypertensive disorders, medical complications, and undetermined. Below, I'll list the percentage of stillbirths in each category (which may be used as prior probabilities) along with some reasons for or against.</p>
<p><em>Obstetrical complications</em> (29%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Against: No abruption detected. No multifetal gestation. No ruptured preterm membranes at 20-24 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Placental abnormalities</em> (24%)</p>
<ul>
<li>For: Excessive fibrin deposition (as concluded in the surgical pathology report). Early acute chorioamnionitis (as conclused in the surgical pathology report, but Dr. M claimed this was caused by the baby's death, not conversely). L has gene variants associated with deep vein thrombosis (AG on rs2227589 per 23andme raw data).</li>
<li>Against: No factor V Leiden mutation (GG on rs6025 per 23andme raw data and confirmed via independent lab test). No prothrombin gene mutation (GG on l3002432 per 23andme raw data and confirmed via independent lab test). L was negative for prothrombin G20210A mutation (as determined by lab test). Anti-thrombin III activity results were within normal reference ranges (as determined by lab test). Protein C activity results were withing normal reference ranges (as determined by lab test). Protein S activity results were within normal reference ranges (as determined by lab test). Protein S antigen (free and total) results were within normal references ranges (as determined by lab test).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Infection </em>(13%)</p>
<ul>
<li>For: L visited a nurse's home during the last week of August that works in a hospital we now know had frequent cases of CMV infection. CMV antibody IgH, CMV IgG, and Parvovirus B-19 Antibody IgG values were outside of normal reference ranges.</li>
<li>Against: Dr. M discounted the viral test results as the cause of death, since the levels suggested the infection had occurred years ago, and therefore could not have caused J's death. Dr. F confirmed Dr. M's assessment.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fetal malformations</em> (14%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Against: No major structural abnormalities. No genetic abnormalities detected (CombiSNP Array for Pregnancy Loss results showed a normal male micro array profile).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Umbilical cord abnormalities</em> (10%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Against: No prolapse. No stricture. No thrombosis.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hypertensive disorder</em> (9%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Against: No preeclampsia. No chronic hypertension.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Medical complications</em> (8%)</p>
<ul>
<li>For: L experienced 2 nights of very painful abdominal pains that could have been contractions on 10/28 and 10/29. L remembers waking up on her back a few nights between 10/20 and 11/05 (it is unclear if this belongs in this category or somewhere else).</li>
<li>Against: No antiphospholipid antibody syndrome detected (determined via Beta-2 Glycoprotein I Antibodies [IgG, IgA, IgM] test). No maternal diabetes detected (determined via glucose test on 10/20).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Undetermined</em> (24%)</p>
<p>What is the most likely cause of death? How likely is that cause? Given that cause, if we choose to have another child, then how likely is it to survive its birth? Are there any other ways I could reduce uncertainty (additional tests, etc...) that I haven't listed here? Are there any other forums where these questions are more likely to get good answers? Why won't doctors give probabilities? Help with any of these questions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>If your advice to me is to consult another expert (in addition to the 2 obstetricians and 1 high-risk obstetrician I already have consulted), <em>please</em> also provide concrete tactics as to how to find such an expert and validate their expertise.</p>

<p>MelbLW's social meetups usually run on the third Friday of each month (this month is an exception). They are casual get-togethers where we chat about topics of interest over a couple of drinks. Some groups will often play games as well.</p>

<p><strong>Where?</strong> The Bull &amp; Bear Tavern, 347 Flinders Ln, Melbourne VIC 3000</p>

<p><strong>When?</strong> From 6:30pm on Friday 22nd. Feel free to show up later, though. We typically stay at the main venue until about 11pm.</p>

<p><strong>Dinner?</strong> The Bull &amp; Bear serve decent pub food and we usually get some wedges etc to share. If you would like to wait, we usually go out for dinner/supper afterwards. This month we might try a new, different venue for our after-meetup meal!</p>

<p><strong>Games?</strong> Feel free to bring a game along if you'd like to play!</p>

<p>I've been trying to write some essays for friends, designed to introduce them to some rationalist ideas on a personal blog. I thought I might be able to post a few here to get some feedback on what I'm doing right/wrong so I can better get the main ideas across.</p>
<p>This is a new project, so I only have a few essays (in differing levels of completion).</p>
<p>This is one that is completed:</p>

One of the responses what a&nbsp;comment saying ""Not until we abandon this mentality, we the victims are the majority, we can take back this country, all we need to do is open our eyes and stand up."" When I saw this comment, I agreed with the sentiment - but nevertheless, I shrugged and moved on. Sure, it is an issue that I strongly believe in, and an issue on which I thought most people would agree with me - but nevertheless, there was nothing I could do about it. Sure, if everyone who agreed on this took a stand (or at least wrote a letter to their congressional representative) we could probably do something about it together - but I could only control my own actions, and in acting alone I'd only be wasting my time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That got me thinking. This isn't the first time I've come across these sorts of issues. At its heart, this is a coordination problem - lots of people want to do something, but it doesn't make sense for any individual to act unless many others do as well. We don't have a way to solve these sorts of problems, which is quite unfortunate. Except... why can't we have such a system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, I'm imagining a website where you get to create ""causes"" and also add your name to them along with a number specifying how many other supporters you'd need to see before you would be willing to take (a pre-specified) action towards the cause. What are the reasons that something like this wouldn't work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fact, we do have several websites that work sort-of like this already. Kickstarter is one. The White House Petitions system is another. The first of these has been a wild success; the second, less so (as far as I understand it). So there is clearly some merit to the idea, but also some major setbacks.&nbsp;</p>

Some say I'm confident, others say I'm arrogant, others remark on how I seem very certain of myself (which I have been told both as compliment and critique).</p><p>I was surprised, at first, by these remarks from friends and family ‚Äî from my perspective, I'm usually the first person in the conversation to express uncertainty in the form of probability estimates and error bars. I'm often quick to brainstorm alternative explanations of the data I use to support my claims. And, of course, I'm certain of nothing.</p><p>In fact, I had a conversation with a friend about this phenomenon once, which went something like this:</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Me:</strong> Hey, have you noticed how everyone thinks I have an aura of confidence and certainty, sometimes arrogance? I don't know how to shake it, nor how it works. What's up with that?</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><strong>Him:</strong> Well, you always seem to have a solid grasp on every situation. When you're explaining things, you answer questions quickly, deftly, and with precision.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><strong>Me:</strong> I don't think that's it, though. I'm rarely confident in the claims I'm making, and I tend to highlight that fact. Earlier, when we were talking with [other friend] about tools society can use to break monopolies, I was very explicit about where my uncertainty lies, and what assumptions my models relied upon, and where they might be flawed.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><strong>Him:</strong> Yeah, but even then you were confident in what you were saying ‚Äî maybe not confident in any particular claim you made, but confident in your overall analysis.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><strong>Me:</strong> I don't think that's it either. I'll be the first to admit that the probabilities I put on my propositions are pulled out of thin air, and I'll also be the first to admit that my hypothesis space is decrepit and that I'd be able to find better models if I could think better. In fact, I'm aware of a bunch of flaws in the ways I think, and I dedicate a decent amount of effort to improving my own reasoning methods.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><strong>Him:</strong> ‚Ä¶</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><strong>Me:</strong> ‚Ä¶ I'm doing the thing right now, aren't I?</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><strong>Him:</strong> Yes, yes you are.</i></p></blockquote><p>There definitely is something of ""confidence"" to this pattern of speech and thinking, but it's not an empirical confidence. The confidence people notice in me isn't in the <i>content</i> of my claims, for I'm quick to couch my claims with probability estimates and error bars. Most of the confidence isn't in my analysis, either; I'm quick to note the ways my analyses could be flawed.</p><p>Some of the confidence <i>does</i> reside in the ways I reason; I do admit that I am much better equipped to answer questions of the form ""but why are you so much more confident in your own reasoning than their reasoning, when they actually have more credentials?"" than most. But even there, I can note plausible biases and judgement errors in my own reasoning processes with alacrity.</p><p>Why, then, do I come off as so confident? Why do I seem so self-assured while listing the ways I know my brain is flawed?</p><p>On reflection, I've concluded that (at least part of) the answer is something I call ""confidence all the way up"". Insofar as I'm uncertain of my content, I'm confident in my analysis ‚Äî except, I'm not fully confident in my analysis. But insofar as I'm uncertain of my analysis, I'm confident in my reasoning procedures ‚Äî except, I don't put faith there, either. But insofar as I'm uncertain of my reasoning procedures, I'm confident in my friends and failsafe mechanisms that will eventually force me to take notice and to update. Except, that's not quite right either ‚Äî it's more like, every lack of confidence is covered by confidence one meta-level higher in the cognitive chain.</p><p>The result is something that reads socially as confidence regardless of how much empirical uncertainty I'm under.</p><hr><p>Where does it bottom out? Well, insofar as my friends and failsafe mechanisms aren't sufficient to raise errors to my attention, I expect to reason poorly in an irredeemable fashion and then fail to achieve my goals. It bottoms out at the point where I say ""yeah, if I'm <i>that far gone</i>, then I fail and die.""</p><p>(And somehow, I'm able to say even this while maintaining my aura of self-assuredness and confidence).</p><p>I have encountered many people who seem paralyzed by their uncertainties. They hit a question (such as ""what methods can a society use to break up monopolies?"") and they are pretty sure that they won't be able to generate the <i>right</i> answers, and so they generate <i>no</i> answers.</p><p>And this may be a better failure mode than the failure mode of someone who has <i>too much</i> confidence and self-assuredness, who makes up a bunch of bad answers and then believes them with all their heart.</p><p>Someone with Confidence All The Way Up, though, can achieve the third alternative: generate a bunch of bad answers, understand why they're bad and where their limitations are, and use that information as best they can.</p><p>I have found this mindset to be very useful throughout my life. Confidence all the way up is what has me dive into the fray to try new things, while others stand on the sidelines bemoaning a high degree of uncertainty. It's part of the technique of <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/where-coulds-go/"">treat recurring failures as data and training</a>, rather than as a signal that it's time to feel guilty. It's part of the technique of <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/not-yet-gods/"">knowing you're deeply limited</a> without letting that interfere with your <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/moving-towards-the-goal/"">progress towards the goal</a>. Of the top ten most competent people I've met in person (by my estimation), eight of them seem to have some variant of confidence all the way up running.

pCesigb4NjzvoNKWB,"To contribute to AI safety, consider doing AI research",to-contribute-to-ai-safety-consider-doing-ai-research,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pCesigb4NjzvoNKWB/to-contribute-to-ai-safety-consider-doing-ai-research,2016-01-16T20:42:36.107Z,39,28,39,False,False,,"<p>Among those concerned about risks from advanced AI, I've encountered people who would be interested in a career in AI research, but are worried that doing so would speed up AI capability relative to safety. I think it is a mistake for AI safety proponents to avoid going into the field for this reason (better reasons include being well-positioned to do AI safety work, e.g. at MIRI or FHI). This mistake contributed to me choosing statistics rather than computer science for my PhD, which I have some regrets about, though luckily there is enough overlap between the two fields that I can work on machine learning anyway. I think the value of having more AI experts who are worried about AI safety is far higher than the downside of adding a few drops to the ocean of people trying to advance AI. Here are several reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concerned researchers can inform and influence their colleagues, especially if they are outspoken about their views.</li>
<li>Studying and working on AI brings understanding of the current challenges and <a href=""http://futureoflife.org/2015/12/29/the-top-a-i-breakthroughs-of-2015/"">breakthroughs</a> in the field, which can usefully inform AI safety work (e.g. <a href=""https://www6.inra.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/LInK/Les-anciens-de-LInK/Laurent-Orseau/Mortal-universal-agents-wireheading"">wireheading in reinforcement learning agents</a>).</li>
<li>Opportunities to work on AI safety are beginning to spring up within academia and industry, e.g. through FLI grants. In the next few years, it will be possible to do an AI-safety-focused PhD or postdoc in computer science, which would hit two birds with one stone.</li>
</ol>
<p>To elaborate on #1, one of the prevailing arguments against taking long-term AI safety seriously is that not enough experts in the AI field are worried. Several prominent researchers have commented on the potential risks (Stuart Russell, Bart Selman, Murray Shanahan, Shane Legg, and others), and more are concerned but keep quiet for reputational reasons. An accomplished, strategically outspoken and/or well-connected expert can make a big difference in the attitude distribution in the AI field and the level of familiarity with the <a href=""http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015"">actual concerns</a> (which are not about malevolence, sentience, or marching robot armies). Having more informed skeptics who have maybe even read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies"">Superintelligence</a>, and fewer uninformed skeptics who think AI safety proponents are afraid of Terminators, would produce much needed direct and productive discussion on these issues. As the proportion of informed and concerned researchers in the field approaches critical mass, the reputational consequences for speaking up will decrease.</p>
<p>A year after FLI's <a href=""http://futureoflife.org/2015/10/12/ai-safety-conference-in-puerto-rico/"">Puerto Rico conference</a>, the subject of long-term AI safety is no longer taboo among AI researchers, but remains rather controversial. Addressing AI risk on the long term will require safety work to be a significant part of the field, and close collaboration between those working on safety and capability of advanced AI. <a href=""https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/research/future/"">Stuart Russell</a> makes the apt analogy that ""just as nuclear fusion researchers consider the problem of containment of fusion reactions as one of the primary problems of their field, issues of control and safety will become central to AI as the field matures"". If more people who are already concerned about AI safety join the field, we can make this happen faster, and help <a href=""http://futureoflife.org/2016/01/07/the-wisdom-race-is-heating-up/"">wisdom win the race with capability</a>.</p>

<p>Once upon a time (true story), I was on my way to a hotel in a new city. &nbsp;I knew the hotel was many miles down this long, branchless road. &nbsp;So I drove for a long while.</p>
<p><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_n6a_2.png?v=e38167d22348b22c2098faf0d51c7a61"" alt="""" width=""638"" height=""195"" /></p>
<p>After a while, I began to worry I had passed the hotel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_n6a_3.png?v=581d1be9b5846545acb660fa23f5322a"" alt="""" width=""638"" height=""195"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, instead of proceeding at 60 miles per hour the way I had been, I continued in the same direction for several more minutes at 30 miles per hour, wondering if I should keep going or turn around.</p>
<p><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_n6a_4.png?v=22e7e9bc8ebb443b87ed6b81ed3e6df7"" alt="""" width=""638"" height=""195"" /></p>
<div>After a while, I realized: I was being silly! &nbsp;If the hotel was ahead of me, I'd get there fastest if I kept going 60mph. &nbsp;And if the hotel was behind me, I'd get there fastest by heading at 60 miles per hour in the other direction. &nbsp;And if I <em>wasn't</em>&nbsp;going to turn around yet -- if my best bet given the uncertainty was to check <em>N</em>&nbsp;more miles of highway first, <em>before</em>&nbsp;I turned around -- then, again, I'd get there fastest by choosing a value of <em>N</em>, speeding along at 60 miles per hour until my odometer said I'd gone <em>N</em>&nbsp;miles, and <em>then</em>&nbsp;turning around and heading at 60 miles per hour in the opposite direction. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Either way, fullspeed was best. &nbsp;My mind had been naively averaging two courses of action -- the thought was something like: ""maybe I should go forward, and maybe I should go backward. &nbsp;So, since I'm uncertain, I should go forward at half-speed!"" &nbsp;But averages don't <em>actually</em> work that way.[1]</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Following this, I started noticing lots of hotels in my life (and, perhaps less tactfully, in my friends' lives). &nbsp;For example:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't sure if I was a good enough writer to write a given doc myself, or if I should try to outsource it. &nbsp;So, I <a href=""/lw/jad/attempted_telekinesis/"">sat there kind-of-writing it</a> while also fretting about whether the task was correct. 
<ul>
<li>(Solution: &nbsp;Take a minute out to think through heuristics. &nbsp;Then, either: (1) write the post at full speed; or (2) try to outsource it; or (3) write full force <em>for some fixed time period</em>, and then pause and evaluate.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I wasn't sure (back in early 2012) that CFAR was worthwhile. &nbsp;So, I kind-of worked on it.</li>
<li>An old friend came to my door unexpectedly, and I was tempted to hang out with her, but I also thought I should finish my work. &nbsp;So I kind-of hung out with her while feeling bad and distracted about my work.</li>
<li>A friend of mine, when teaching me math, seems to mumble <em>specifically those words that he doesn't expect me to understand</em>&nbsp;(in a sort of compromise between saying them and not saying them)...</li>
<li>Duncan <a href=""http://thirdfoundation.github.io/#/blog/quittability"">reports</a> that novice Parkour students are unable to safely undertake certain sorts of jumps, because they risk aborting the move mid-stream, after the <em>actual</em>&nbsp;last safe stopping point (apparently kind-of-attempting these jumps is more dangerous than either attempting, or not attempting the jumps)</li>
<li>It is said that start-up founders need to be irrationally certain that their startup will succeed, lest they be unable to do more than kind-of work on it...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>That is, it seems to me that often there are two different actions that would make sense under two different models, and we are uncertain which model is true... and so we find ourselves taking an intermediate of half-speed action... even when that action makes no sense under any probabilistic mixture of the two models.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_n6a_5.png?v=a8df41062ca5967c7f5e1cfb195fc243"" alt="""" width=""632"" height=""334"" /><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>You might try looking out for such examples in your life.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<hr />
</div>
<div><strong>[1] Edited to add:</strong> The hotel example has received much nitpicking in the comments. &nbsp;But: (A) the actual example was legit, I think. &nbsp;Yes, stopping to think has some legitimacy, but driving slowly for a long time because uncertain does not optimize for thinking. &nbsp;Similarly, it may make sense to drive slowly to stare at the buildings in some contexts... but I was on a very long empty country road, with no buildings anywhere (true historical fact), and also I was not squinting carefully at the scenery. &nbsp;The thing I needed to do was to execute an efficient search pattern, with a threshold for a future time at which to switch from full-speed in some direction to full-speed in the other. &nbsp;Also: (B) consider some of the other examples; ""kind of working"", ""kind of hanging out with my friend"", etc. seem to be common behaviors that are mostly not all that useful in the usual case.</div>",AnnaSalamon,annasalamon,AnnaSalamon,

<p>The various EA nonprofits each have a claim to effective altruism, and there is lots of uncertainty about which will end up being the most effective; we can give to AMF and save lives in the near future for around $1,000 a life, or try policy interventions, with unknown effects, or perhaps we should try prevent one of severeal potential tail risks that could destroy humanity in the near or far future. The experts in each area argue for their cause, and we'd love a clearer way to think about the options. Come join us as we try to find one!</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>A system that is optimizing a function of n variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size k&lt;n, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.</p>
<p><em>Stuart Russell</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of an AI directing a car, given the instructions to get someone to the airport as fast as possible (optimised variables include ""negative of time taken to airport"") with some key variables left out - such as a maximum speed, maximum acceleration, respect for traffic rules, and survival of the passengers and other humans.</p>
<p>Call these other variables ""unstated objectives"" (UO), as contrasted with the ""stated objectives"" (SO) such as the time to the airport. In the normal environments in which we operate and design our AIs, the UOs are either correlated with the SOs (consider the SO ""their heart is beating"" and the UO ""they're alive and healthy"") or don't change much at all (the car-directing AI could have been trained on many examples of driving-to-the-airport, none of which included the driver killing their passengers).</p>
<p>Typically, SOs are easy to define, and the UOs are the more important objectives, left undefined either because they are complex, or because they didn't occur to us in this context (just as we don't often say ""driver, get me to the airport as fast a possible, but alive and not permanently harmed, if you please. Also, please obey the following regulations and restrictions: 1.a.i.&alpha;: Non-destruction of the Earth...."").</p>
<p>The control problem, in a nutshell, is that optimising SOs will typically set other variables to extreme values, including the UOs. The more extreme the optimisation, and the furthest from the typical environment, the more likely this is to happen.<a id=""more""></a></p>
<p>One of the ideas of reduced impact is to preserve the typical environment, so that the unchanging UOs are left unchanged and the correlation remains between the changing UOs and the changing SOs. I've had some ideas for optimisation that ""<a href=""/r/discussion/lw/ly9/crude_measures/"">doesn't optimise too much</a>"". <a href=""http://jessic.at/"">Jessica Taylor</a> has been formalising similar ideas; the idea for both is to preserve the connection between SOs and UOs by preserving certain assumptions about in the standard environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Inverse Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>But those methods are somewhat indirect. What we would ideally want is an AI that can deduce the UOs that we haven't stated, and act on them instead. Then we wouldn't need to try and preserve the environment, nor need to hope that the unseen correlations continue to stand up.</p>
<p>This is similar to the approach taken by <a href=""http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml00-irl.pdf"">inverse reinforcement learning</a>&nbsp;(IRL) - the problem of deducing the correct reward function (equivalent, in our setup, to the objectives SO+UO we want the AI to maximise), given observed behaviour by an expert. In our example above, the AI could observe many human drivers going to the airport, and deduce the reward function corresponding to their behaviour. A good summary can be found in the paper ""<a href=""http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/choi11a/choi11a.pdf"">Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Partially Observed Environments</a>"", that extend the results to - you guessed it - partially observed environments.</p>
<p>There seem to be two major classes of IRL algorithms. The first one deduces the reward function for a given expert policy (as an aside, the important thing is to find a reward function that distinguishes that policy from other policies; ""always get the same reward, whatever you do"" is a reward function that is compatible with all policies). The second class is given ""sampled trajectories"" (equivalent with observed behaviours) and tries to deduce the reward from that.</p>
<p>In that second case, some linearity assumptions are made, in that the reward is assumed to be of the type:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">R(s,a) =&nbsp;<strong>&alpha;</strong> .&nbsp;<strong>&Phi;</strong>(s,a),</p>
<p>where R is the reward from taking action a in state s,&nbsp;<strong>&Phi;</strong> is a fixed vector-valued function mapping (s,a) into some d-dimensional space, and&nbsp;<strong>&alpha;</strong> is a d-dimensional vector (without loss of generality, <strong>&alpha;</strong>&isin;[-1,1]<sup>d</sup>). Then R is given by the inner product of&nbsp;<strong>&alpha;</strong> and <strong>&Phi;</strong>. The IRL algorithm then attempts to compute the values of the components of&nbsp;<strong>&alpha;</strong>. Note that if d is larger than the size of the state&nbsp;&times; action space, then any reward can be expressed in this form (for spanning&nbsp;<strong>&Phi;</strong>); it's only for smaller d that the above is a simplification.</p>
<p>Then there are various algorithms that can deduce the values of&nbsp;<strong>&alpha;</strong> from the sampled trajectories. The algorithms often have a sparseness parameter that prefers simpler values (generally those where R is zero most of the time).</p>
<p>It seems likely that the two approaches - learning from explicit policy information and learning from observed trajectories - can be combined. The SO can form constraints on the value of R, with the algorithms finding&nbsp;<strong>&alpha;</strong> subject to those constraints - in other words, to start from the SO and fill in the UO that the human behaviour is secretly revealing. I'll soon try and set this up (if it hasn't been done already in the literature, which is quite likely).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Variables and the environment</h2>
<p>Now, the original algorithms prefer sparse reward functions (R's that are often non-zero). We don't want to bake in sparseness requirements - cutting down to too few objectives is part of the problem with optimisers. Ideally we'd want to get some estimate as to the complexity or size of the set of true human preferences, and aim the AI at developing rewards at around that complexity.</p>
<p>Then, with enough data, the AI should be able to find all the UOs that are correlated with the SOs in the&nbsp;sampled trajectories&nbsp;it is given. There are two problems: first, it will add objectives that are entirely spurious and coincidental. If we train the AI on only positive examples, it could deduce that increased entropy and increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere are both UO, since they appear in all successful examples. The second problem is that for the UOs that are not changed in any of the examples, the AI can't deduce anything about them. If there are no fatal crashes (or fatal crashes carefully averted at the cost of going slower), the AI will not see the necessity of keeping the passengers alive.</p>
<p>The first issue can be addressed by incorporating explicitly bad trajectories into the training set, showing that certain behaviours should be specifically avoided. Then, since entropy increase and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are also present in the bad examples, the AI can realise that they are not likely to be desired outcomes. I'm not sure if IRL has been done with bad examples yet, but it needs to be done with care - we need to encode somehow that these examples are bad, but not maximally bad. Maybe the driver made a mistake, but they weren't actively trying to kill their passengers. In a sense we need the AI to try to extend to a full model of the all possible environments, dividing a full description into a set of variable: SO+UO+FV. The FV are free variables - values we explicitly don't care about. For instance, we don't actually intrinsically care about entropy and CO<sub>2</sub> levels - we care about some consequences they have on other objectives.</p>
<p>The second issue is more tricky. There is no way of establishing it directly from the trajectories given. One approach would be for the AI to ask humans about candidate UOs (with all the <a href=""/lw/f3v/cake_or_death/"">usual</a> <a href=""/lw/jxa/proper_value_learning_through_indifference/"">precautions</a> on value learning). This would allow some extension of the SOs, that could cover more cases. However, this wouldn't allow the mastery of complicated UOs (ie you can learn about hearts beating, but not about health and well-being). The best approach would be to get examples from very different environments. This could happen either by humans generating more trajectories in new environments of their choice, by humans generating more trajectories in new environments of the AI's choice, or humans defining hypothetical trajectories in new hypothetical environments. All of these can allow the AI to hone in on the correct class of UOs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ontological crisis</h2>
<p>It seems that this method could be used similarly in the case of an <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ontological_crisis"">ontological crisis</a> (a situation where the fundamental assumptions about reality are changed or turn out to be different). Now, there is a sense in which ontological crisis and extensions beyond the training data can be seen as <a href=""/r/discussion/lw/n6c/stub_ontological_crisis_out_of_environment/"">the same thing</a>. But even without that assumption, it seems that the methods above could deal with an ontological crisis.</p>
<p>First, imagine that the AI has a bunch of SO+UO correctly and fully encoding human preferences. Then, an ontological change strikes - the laws of reality are different (maybe a classical AI discovers quantum physics). The AI can keep its SOs/UOs if they can be phrased in terms of the new laws, and then attempt to flesh them out with new UOs to correspond to the new reality. The AI has another tool at is disposal, though: it can generate new sample trajectories. It can use its old model to generate behaviour it would have taken, back when it believed the model was true (we can imagine an internal process in the AI's brain, where one module is saying ""Warning! Ontological change imminent!"" and another reacts by quickly generating hypothetical sample trajectories according to its current understanding). Then, as long as those sample trajectories are still possible in the new model, it can use them as examples for finding UOs. In fact, that last method can work even if the initial SOs/UOs cannot be explicitly extended to the new ontology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Complexity, bias, error, and value</h2>
<p>In all the previous, I've been skirting a crucial issue. Humans make mistakes [citation, as they say, needed]. The sample trajectories will include examples of error, suboptimal choices, and biases. Dealing with these is a subtle issue I won't be going into here. We have to somehow distinguish between noise, errors, errors due to bounded rationality, errors due to inaccurate information, biases, preferences, preferences we'd think of as biases until they were fully explained to us, biases we'd think of as preferences until they were fully explained to us, issues where our ultimate conclusion depends strongly on <em>which</em> explanation <a href=""http://www.qualtrics.com/blog/biased-data-is-bad-data-how-to-think-about-question-order/"">we see first</a>, and issues that humans can be left to sort out on their own.</p>
<p>But, laying that to one side for the moment, there is one aspect I want to bring up: I vaguely mentioned that we wanted an AI to develop a reward function or preference set around the size of the complexity of human preferences.</p>
<p>Now, it would be very hard to estimate this size, but it's clear there is a tension. A large size allows many biases to creep in and be regarded as preferences. A small size would relegate some preferences to being biases. It seems to me that we should be very liberal in this regard: biases which remain in the AIs model of SO+UO are likely to be minor biases (as major biases will have been stated by humans as things to avoid). These are biases so small that we're probably not aware of them. Compared with the possibility of losing something human-crucial we didn't think of explicitly stating, I'd say the case is strong to err on the size of increased complexity/more biases and preferences allowed. Essentially, we're unlikely to have missed some biases we'd really care about eliminating, but very likely to have missed some preference we'd really miss if it were gone.</p>
<p>There are some subtleties with this picture. Consider our current bias preferring <a href=""https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers.htm/oc.html"">omission over commission</a>. We really do blame people less for not doing something (that allows a bad thing to happen) than for actively doing something bad. It's very plausible that such ""preferences"" cannot easily be justified, no matter how much the AI tries. However, a root extraction of this bias may remove many crucial aspects of humanity. It seems that the ideal might be preserving this human preference, but restructuring the world so that it has little detrimental impact. That sort of ""ideal"", however, is not one that can be reached by the process described above (the same argument can be applied to many examples ""idealised preferences""). Further research and clarification is needed.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

		    <div class=""md""><p>This is the second recent meetup in the Baltimore area. We'll be meeting at the Panera Bread in Pikesville.</p>

<p>Discussion topic is whether and how much to update your opinions when you discover that those who you respect as epistemic peers or superiors disagree with you.</p>

<p>The subagent problem, in a nutshell, is that ""create a powerful subagent with goal U that takes over the local universe"" is a solution for many of the goals an AI could have - in a sense, the ultimate convergent instrumental goal. And it tends to evade many clever restrictions people try to program into the AI (eg ""make use of only X amount of negentropy"", ""don't move out of this space"").</p>
<p>So if the problem could be solved, many other control approaches could be potentially available.</p>
<p>The problem is very hard, because an imperfect definition of a subagent is simply an excuse to create an a subagent that skirts the limits of that definition (hum, that style of problem sounds familiar). For instance, if we want to rule out subagents by preventing the AI from having much influence if the AI itself were to stop (""If you die, you fail, no other can continue your quest""), then it is motivated to create powerful subagents that carefully reverse their previous influence if the AI were to be destroyed.</p>
<h1>Controlling subagents</h1>
<p>Some of the methods I've developed seem suitable for controlling the existence or impact of subagents.</p>
<p>Reduced impact methods can prevent subagents from being created, by requiring that the AI's interventions be non-disruptive (""Twenty million questions"") or undetectable.
Reducing the AI's output options to a specific set can prevent them from being able to create any in the first place.
Various methods around detecting importance can be used to ensure that, though subagents may exist, they won't be very influential.
Pre-corriged methods can be used to ensure that any subagents remain value aligned with the original agent. Then, if there is some well-defined ""die"" goal for the agent, this could take all the agents with them.
These can be thought as ruling out the agent's existence, their creation, their influence (or importance) and their independence. The last two can be particularly tricky, as we want to make sure that our formal definition of importance matches up with our informal one, and we currently lack a well defined ""die"" goal.</p>
<p>We could also think of defining identity by using some of the tricks and restrictions that have caused humans to develop one (such as our existing in a single body with no east of copying), but it's not clear that this definition would remain stable once the restrictions were lifted (and it's not clear that a sense of identity prevents the creation of subagents in the first place).</p>
<h1>Subagents processing information</h1>
<p>Here I want to look at one other aspect of the subagents, the fact that they are subagents, and, as such, do some of the stuff that agents do - such as processing information and making decisions. Can we use the information processing as a definition?</p>
<p>Consider the following model. Our lovely Clippy wants to own a paperclip. They know that it exists behind one of a hundred doors; opening one of them seals all the others, for ever. In a few minutes, Clippy will be put to sleep, but it has a simple robot that it can program to go and open one of the doors and recuperate the paperclip for it.</p>
<p>Clippy currently doesn't know where the paperclip is, but it knows that its location will be announced a few seconds after Clippy sleeps. The robot includes a sound recording system inside it.</p>
<p>It seems there are two clear levels of agency the robot could have: either it goes to a random door, or it processes the announcement, to pick the correct door. In the first case, the robot and Clippy have a 1% chance of getting the paperclip; in the second, a 100% chance. The distributions of outcomes is clearly different.</p>
<p>But now suppose there is a human guard longing around, trying to prevent the robot from getting to any door. If the robot has a neutron bomb, it can just kill the human without looking. If it has a giant cannon, it can simply shoot the guard where they stand. If it has neither of these, then it can attempt to bargain with the guard, negotiating, seducing and tricking them in the course of a conversation. One the guard is removed, the situation reverts to the above.</p>
<p>Each of the three methods requires different level of information processing (different levels of optimisation power, in essence). We can add more guards, make them more or less competent, add other agents with other goals, add more ways of achieving the paperclip, and so on, to grade how much information processing the robot has.</p>
<p>To calibrate such a scale, we could use the upper bound as ""Clippy moves into the robot and controls it fully"" to represent the robot having maximal information processing power (and a very focused outcome space). And we could use some pre-prepared actions (such as the robot randomly choosing a door) to calibrate the lower end. The aim is to construct a definition of information processing that could be used to define the existence of (effective) subagents.</p>
<p>Still feels likely that this will fail, though, without something more.</p>

We can add more guards, make them more or less competent, add other agents with other goals, add more ways of achieving the paperclip, and so on, to grade how much information processing the robot has.</p>
<p>To calibrate such a scale, we could use the upper bound as ""Clippy moves into the robot and controls it fully"" to represent the robot having maximal information processing power (and a very focused outcome space). And we could use some pre-prepared actions (such as the robot randomly choosing a door) to calibrate the lower end. The aim is to construct a definition of information processing that could be used to define the existence of (effective) subagents.</p>
<p>Still feels likely that this will fail, though, without something more.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

iQnL6ytc4W3S8QGTm,Instrumental behaviour: Inbox zero - A guide,instrumental-behaviour-inbox-zero-a-guide,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iQnL6ytc4W3S8QGTm/instrumental-behaviour-inbox-zero-a-guide,2016-01-12T07:28:04.904Z,6,5,12,False,False,,"<p>This will be brief.</p>
<p>Inbox zero is a valuable thing to maintain. &nbsp;Roughly promoted around the web as having an empty inbox.</p>
<p>An email inbox collects a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>junk</li>
<li>automatic mail sent to you</li>
<li>personal mail sent to you</li>
<li>work sent to you</li>
<li>(maybe - work you send to yourself because that's the best way to store information for now)</li>
</ul>
<div>An inbox is a way to keep track of ""how much I have to do yet"". &nbsp;Because of this; it's incredibly valuable to try to get to inbox zero.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This guide is for anyone with bajillions of emails in their inbox, some read; some not. &nbsp;If you have an email system in place; don't change it. &nbsp;if not - get one. &nbsp;(maybe not this one - but do it).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<hr />
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>0. decide that this is a good idea (this can be done after) but mostly I want to say - don't half-arse this, you might end up in a no-mans-land between the old and the new.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>1. A program. </strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I recommend Thunderbird because it's free. &nbsp;I used to work in a webmail system but the speed of webmail is a joke in comparison to local mail. &nbsp;also offline-powers are handy from time to time. &nbsp;(Disadvantage - not always having backups for everything)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>2. Archive system</strong></div>
<div>This being January 2016 we are going to make a few main folders. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Old as all hell (or other friendly name)</li>
<li>2014</li>
<li>2015</li>
<li>2016</li>
</ul>
<div>Anything older than 2014 will probably never get looked at again; (just ask any email veteran) That's okay - that's what archives are for.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>3. Old</strong></div>
<div>Put anything old into the old folder</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>4. 2014</strong></div>
<div>That was two years ago! &nbsp;it will also go the same way as old-as-all-hell, but for now it can sit in 2014.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>5. 2015</strong></div>
<div>two options here - either:</div>
<div>a. leave them in your inbox and through the year sort them into the 2015 folder; remembering that things that old should go to sleep easy.</div>
<div>b. put them in <strong>2015</strong>&nbsp;where you can look at them when you need them.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>6. 2016</strong></div>
<div>There are a few simple behaviours that make the ongoing use of the system handy.</div>
<div>a. if you read a thing, and you have <strong>no more to do</strong> with it; file it away into <strong>2016</strong></div>
<div>b. if you read a thing and still have more to do; leave it in the inbox (If you can resolve it in under 5 minutes; try to do it now)</div>
<div>c. if you don't plan to read a thing AND it's not important AND you don't want to delete it; I strongly advise <strong>unsubscribing from the source</strong>; finding a way to stop them from coming in, or setting up a rule to auto-sort into a folder.</div>
<div>d. &nbsp;Every automatically generated email has an unsubscribe button at the bottom. &nbsp;If you have a one-time unsubscribe policy you will never have to see the same junk twice.</div>
<div>e. do some work; answer emails; send other emails etc. &nbsp;and file things as you go.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>7. other email folders</strong></div>
<div>sure sometimes things need a bit of preserving; sometimes things need sorting - go ahead and do that. &nbsp;Don't let me stop you.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Using this fairly ordinary system I can get my total email time down to about half an hour a week.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Don't like it? find a better system. &nbsp;But don't leave them all there.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Final note: I have an email address for things I subscribe to that is separate to the email address I give out or use; this way I can check my subscriptions quickly without mixing them up with work/life/important things.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>

<div>This post came out of a discussion in the IRC. &nbsp;It took 30mins to write and is probably full of errors and in need of improving; this was written with no research and there are likely better systems in existence. &nbsp;It partially incorporates a ""Getting Things Done"" attitude but I might post more about that soon.</div>

<p>Don't have any conversations with it whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll explain how this would work in a second, but first some motivation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Consider all the great scientific discoveries over the course of human history -- Newtonian mechanics, relativity, algorithms for primality testing, etc etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could a ""God"" who is ``bad at math'' have created the universe in order to have us make these discoveries for him?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds insane: surely any being with the power to create our universe would know how to check if a number is prime.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>But perhaps it isn't insane. Consider that at this point in its history, we</p>
<p>a) do not know how to factor numbers efficiently.</p>
<p>b) can create rudimentary simulated worlds (e.g., world of warcraft or your favorite MMO).</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Here is how the scheme could work in more detail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine your typical world of warcraft server, but each orc and human is controlled by a trained neural network of complexity roughly the same as the average human.</p>
<p>The simulated world does not have enough natural food for orc or human populations to thrive. The life of man and orc is, in the words of Hobbes, ""poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it does contain an ocean which washes up pebbles in the shore. Pebbles come in two types, red and black. The black pebbles have labels, which are randomly assigned from the set ""0"", ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", ""9"", ""x"", ""="". The red pebbles have strings of the same symbols written on them.</p>
<p>When you arrange the following sequence of pebbles &nbsp;</p>
<p>2x3=6</p>
<p>(all in black up to and including the ""="" and the last ""6"" is red)&nbsp;</p>
<p>they crack open, and inside is enough food to feed a village for a year.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 2x3=5 has no effect.</p>
<p>The longer the prime factorization, the more food is in the pebbles.</p>
<p>No other way to open the pebbles exists.</p>
<p>Once you have arranged 2x3=6, the next time you arrange it with new pebbles gives you 99% as much food; the next time after that, 99% of 99%, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Societies in this simulated world will devote a lot of effort to figuring out the prime factorizations of the red numbers which wash up on the shore.</p>
<p>We program things so that, over time, length of the numbers on the red pebbles which get washed up on the shore gets longer and longer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since computers are so much faster than humans, and the orcs/humans in this world are about as smart as we are, we might let this society run for a few million simulated human-years before examining the data dump from it. If a polynomial time algorithm for factoring primes exist, they will likely have found it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>Given more difficult problems we want solved, we can imagine other ways of embedding them into the physics of the simulated world. Consider, for example, how the Schrodinger equation is embedded into the fabric of our universe. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>My question is: what can go wrong?</p>
<p>I can think of a couple of potential issues and am wondering whether I missed anything.</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong>One problem is, of course, that someone might misuse the technology, running this experiment while breaking the protocol and telling the simulated people facts about our world. Of course, this is a generic problem with any protocol for any problem (bad things happen if you don't follow it). &nbsp;</p>
<p>A related problem is that we might have activists who advocate for the rights of simulated man/orc; such activists might interrupt one of the experiments halfway through and break the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We might lessen the risk of this by, say, making each experiment take less than one second of real time. Given that the current speed of the top supercomputer in the world is on the order of 10^16 flops per second, and projecting that into the future, one second might equal millions of years of simulated time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is actually a good idea also for the following reason: the simulated people might realize that they are in a simulated world.</p>
<p>They might spend a lot of effort begging us to give them immortality or more pebbles. We might give in if we heard them. Best to make it impossible for us to hear their pleas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will eventually cease trying to contact us once they realize no one is listening.</p>
<p>Ethically, I think one could justify all this. It is hard to argue, for example, that we (real human beings) have been harmed by being brought into existence in a universe without a God who is listening; almost all of us would prefer to be alive rather not. The same would go for them: surely, their simulated existence, imperfect as it is, &nbsp;is not worse than not having been brought into the world in the first place?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They might become discouraged once they receive no answers from us, but I think this is not inevitable. Suppose, for example, you come to believe the real world has been created for the purpose of solving math problems; most of us would be shaken by this but likely would go on to live our lives as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, if we wanted to avoid all this we might consider more subtle ways of embedding problems into the rules of their world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Perhaps the most serious problem might be if there is a bug in our code for the simulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the worst case, they might be able to come up with some kind of exploit that lets them see anything stored on the computer running the simulation, in particular the source code of their universe. One might imagine they would even be able to modify said source code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>One possible way to solve this would to write the simulation with the aid of some kind of program-checking software that ensures things like this will not happen.</em> &nbsp;Already, people are playing around with tools that enable you to write code which comes with a guarantee that the program will not enter into certain states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, even if a bug were to occur, it seems it would be quite difficult for them to take over the world -- though perhaps not impossible. I don't think they could obtain knowledge of the hardware they are running on -- only the software (people who know computer architecture, correct me if I'm wrong?). And they don't know the physics of our world. &nbsp;If the computer which runs the simulation is not connected to any network -- say it is stored underground in a soundproof vault -- I'm at a loss to imagine how they would take over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: note that the last paragraph was a parenthetical remark -- the real solution is to use program checking to ensure no violation of the physical laws of their world happens.</p>
<p><strong>10. </strong>Why would we do any of this relative to, say, mind uploads which run at many times the speed of ordinary humans? Because an uploaded mind knows quite a bit about human psychology and the physics of the world, and could potentially use this knowledge in ways harmful to us. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp;</strong>One can view this scheme as a kind of genetic algorithm (in a sense, it <em>is</em> a genetic algorithm).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12. </strong>Finally: many people have written about friendly AI, and I've not been able to read everything (or even most) of what is written. Apologies if something like this has been discussed at length before -- in which case, I'd appreciate a pointer to the relevant discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most relevant thing I've seen here is <a href=""/lw/qk/that_alien_message/"">That Alien Message</a>, which is really close to item 9, but still imagines interaction with the AI in the box, giving the AI an opportunity to convince us to let it use the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Let me say something about why the simulated beings will not be able to figure out the physical laws of our world (though they might have a range of plausible guesses about it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine you live in a world governed by Newtonian mechanics: every experiment you do is perfectly, 100% explained by Newton's laws. You come to believe you live in a simulation intended to force you to solve second order differential equations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can you deduce about the physics of the real world?</p>
<p>Answer: nothing. Newton's laws is the only information you have. And that is just not enough information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the real world is governed by Newton's laws just like yours. Or maybe it has general relativity (you are smart enough to figure out that is a possibility). Or maybe it is governed by F=m x'''. Electromagnetism might exist or it might not. Ditto for quantum mechanics. The real world could be discrete of continuous. How big could g, G, and Planck's constant be in the real world? Is there another force like gravity which roughly acts on the same scale? In fact, the possibilities are endless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You just don't know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now suppose you are actually a superintelligence. You are really, really smart. What can you infer about the laws of physics which govern real world?</p>
<p>The answer, I believe, the same as above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A superintelligence may be smart, but its abilities are not without limit. It cannot solve a problem for which there is not enough information to solve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider that world of warcraft feels the same an orc regardless of whether it runs on a pc or a mac of a quantum computer. Just experiencing a world with Newton's laws will not reveal any information about the hardware your universe is running on.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge, however, that the super-intelligence might come up with a large list of possible guesses about what our physics could be.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: If it sounds to you like the AIs might take over our world with this scheme, consider the following scenario.</p>
<p>Suppose that we terminate the simulation after a million years. We have a particular second order differential equation in mind before starting the simulation. After termination, every record of the simulated world is destroyed, except for any time someone has written a solution to this specific differential equation on a piece of paper. This is done automatically by the code. An automatic differentiation algorithm checks whether the solution is correct. If it is, it shows us the solution; else, it deletes it along with the rest of the record of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The output is either nothing, or a solution to the differential equation we wanted solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(of course, this is a toy scenario; more realistically, we will want a solution to a more difficult scientific problem)</p>
<p>Assuming no bugs in the code, can you give an account of how a superintelligence could take over the real world in this scenario?</p>",ZoltanBerrigomo,zoltanberrigomo,ZoltanBerrigomo,

<p><strong>Half*-Sleeping Beauty Problem</strong></p>
<p>The asterisk is because it is only very similar to half of the sleeping beauty problem, not exactly half.</p>
<p>A coin is flipped. If it is heads, you are woken up with 50% chance and interrogated about the probability of the coin having come up heads. The other 50% of the time you are killed. If it is tails you are woken up and similarly interrogated. Given that you are being interrogated, what is the probability that the coin came up heads? And have you received any new information?</p>
<p><strong>Double-Half*-Sleeping Beauty problem<br /></strong></p>
<p>A coin is flipped. If it is heads, a coin is flipped again. If this second coin is heads you are woken up and interrogated on Monday, if it is tails you are woken up and interrogated on Tuesday. If it is tails, then you are woken up on Monday and Tuesday and interrogated both days (having no memory of your previous interrogation). If you are being interrogated, what is the chance the coin came up heads? And have you received any new information?</p>
<p><strong>Double-Half*-Sleeping Beauty problem with Known Day Variation<br /></strong></p>
<div>EDIT: This problem should have said: As above, but whenever you are being interrogated you are told the day. You may wish to consider this problem before the above one.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<p><strong>Sleeping Couples Problem</strong></p>
<p>A man and his identical-valued wife have lived together for so many years that they have reached <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem"">Aumann agreement</a> on all of their beliefs, including core premises, so that they always make the same decision in every situation.</p>
<p>A coin is flipped. If it is heads, one of the couple is randomly woken up and interrogated about the probability of the coin having come up heads. The other is killed. If it is tales, both are woken up separately and similarly interrogated. If you are being interrogated, what is the probability that the coin came up heads? And have you received any new information?</p>
<p><strong>Sleeping Clones Problem</strong></p>
<p>A coin is flipped. If it is heads, you are woken up and interrogated about the probability of the coin having come up heads. If it is tails, then you are cloned and both copies are interrogated separately without knowing whether they are the clone or not. If you are being interrogated, what is the probability that the coin came up heads? And have you received any new information?</p>
<p>My expectation is that the Double-Half Sleeping Beauty and Sleeping Clones will be controversial, but I am optimistic that there will be a consensus on the other three.</p>
<p>Solutions (or at least what I believe to be the solutions) will be forthcoming soon.</p>",casebash,casebash,casebash,

tteNT2GqoJ75riTyd,Are we failing the ideological Turing test in the case of ISIS? (a crazy ideas thread),are-we-failing-the-ideological-turing-test-in-the-case-of,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tteNT2GqoJ75riTyd/are-we-failing-the-ideological-turing-test-in-the-case-of,2016-01-09T16:42:59.906Z,-2,14,86,False,False,,"<p>It is easy to think of the ISIS as just a bunch of lunatics who kill people because they believe God told them to do it, but if we take a closer look at how they are organized and how successful they are, (and especially how successful they were at the beginning), this seems to be an oversimplification. Sure, most of their lowest level fighters are probably belonging to the ""brainwashed and crazy"" group, but I guess the leadership is almost certainly not. They know and use modern media very well, they are effective at recruitment, advertising, organization, and secrecy. Their successes are aided by the fact that they know how we think much better than how we know how they think.</p>
<p>Most of what they do seem to be very rational from a utilitarian point of view: they destroy pre-islamic historical monuments (which previous Islamic theocratic governments left intact) to show their supporters that they are in control and that they are serious, they try to trick NATO and the Russians to commit ground troops, so they can recruit the less radical Muslims to defend their homes against ""foreign conquerors"", and they cater for both the religious fanatics, and for the opportunists. They have many mercenaries on their side, simply because they can pay them better than others in the region. They also gain recruits by promising them wealth and power, so not all their rhetoric is strictly religiously motivated.</p>
<p>With the most repeated assumptions about their true goals and motivations being ""they just want power"", ""they are just crazy"", and ""they just enjoy being evil"", it seems that we are failing the ideological Turing test.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest a thread similar to the ""Crazy Ideas Threads"": let us assume, that the top leadership of ISIS is composed of <strong>completely rational</strong> and <strong>very intelligent</strong> individuals, and let's try to guess what their true goals and motivations are. I have a number of ideas, but I can find many arguments both for and against them. I encourage you to criticize the ideas I came up with, and suggest your own theories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol> </ol>
<p><em>1. The premise of this article is wrong. The ISIS are really just a bunch of idiots, and their apparent successes are only caused by the powers in the region being much more incompetent than ISIS</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>2. They want to create a sovereign nation and become its ruling elite.</em></p>
<p>The problem with this is that their current economic model is <a href=""http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10572/what-forces-incentives-drove-the-mongols-to-conquer-a-much-larger-land-territory/10588#10588"">unsustainable in the long term</a>. When conquering and looting new territory makes up most of your income, once you exhausted an area, you need to find new places to conquer. When you can no longer do it, your economy collapses. Until now, looting the towns they conquered, selling artifacts and robbing the banks found in the town made up a large part of their income. They have no real industry to speak of, except for selling the oil extracted by already existing infrastructure. If you think this is the real answer, please indicate a realistic economic model for the geographical area which is mostly defined by the power vacuum they managed to exploit, and which as of today seems to be mostly filled by them, making them unlikely to continue to gain significant new territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>3. They just want to amass as much wealth as possible, and then comfortably retire to some secluded place.</em></p>
<p>The problem with this is that they made some of the greatest powers on the planet their enemies, who will have a high probability of finding and hunting them down if they, for example, just retire to a sunny beach of a tropical island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Trying to make their ideology more dominant (aka spreading Islam in general)</p>
<p>I find this the least likely as the main goal. Also, if this was the case, they are counterproductive. So far Islam was very successful in the last few decades to gain a bigger and bigger foothold in the Western world, helped both by demographics and by the predominantly left-leaning political elite in Europe encouraging the acceptance of and submission to Islamic culture in Europe instead of encouraging the immigrants to abandon their culture for the culture of the host nations. However, the recent terrorist attacks, and the many atrocities committed by the recently arrived asylum seekers, while hurting European economy, will probably lead to Europe being more skeptical regarding Islam, which might reduce the chances of Islam peacefully and silently spreading. So these events, if indeed orchestrated by ISIS, might have been successful in harming the economy of their enemies, but I don't know what an effect they had on the spreading of Islam. I'm tending on believing in a negative effect, but I just don't know enough factors to know it for sure. I believe the violent attacks in the Western world are done mostly to show their own followers at home how powerful they are and how weak their enemies are.</p>
<p>Other, not necessarily rational motivations:</p>
<p>- they just saw an opportunity and exploited it, they have no long term contingency plans.</p>
<p>- they really believe that what they do will, in the long therm, benefit the people in the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: by presenting the above theories, my goal was not to claim them to be true or false. My goal is to listen to interesting ideas and theories which maybe didn't occur to me before.</p>",Val,val,Val,

<blockquote>
<p>Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One way of framing this is that, when you are solving some optimization problem, a metric that is correlated with a desired objective will often stop being correlated with the objective when you look at the extreme values of the metric.  For example, although the number of paperclips a paperclip factory produces tends to be correlated with how useful the factory is for its owner's values, a paperclip factory that produces an extremely high number of paperclips is likely to be quite bad for its owner's values.</p>

<p>This article is a follow up to:&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/n59/the_number_choosing_game_against_the_existence_of/"">The Number Choosing Game: Against the existence of perfect theoretical rationality</a>. It discusses the consequences of The Number Choosing Game, which is roughly, that you name the decimal representation of any number and you gain that much utility. It takes place in a theoretical world where there are no real world limitations in how large a number you can name or any costs. We can also assume that this game takes place outside of regular time, so there is no opportunity cost. Needless to say, this was all rather controversial.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Originally I was trying to separate the consequences from the arguments, but it seems that this blog post slipped away from it.</p>
<p><strong>What does this actually mean for the real world?</strong></p>
<p>This was one of the most asked questions in the previous thread. I will answer this, but first I want to explain why I was reluctant to answer. I agree that it is often good to tell people what the real world consequences are as this isn't always obvious. Someone may miss out on realising how important an idea is if this isn't explained to them. However, I wanted to fight against the idea that people should always be spoonfed the consequences of every argument. A rational agent should have some capacity to think for themselves - maybe I tell you that the consequences are X, but they are actually Y. I also see a great deal of value from discussing the truth of ideas separate from the practical consequences. Ideally, everyone would be blind to the practical consequences when they were first discussing the truth of an idea as it would lead to a reduction in motivated reasoning.</p>
<p>The consequences of this idea are in one sense quite modest. If perfect rationality doesn't exist in at least some circumstances<span style=""font-size: 10.8333px;""><sub>(edited)</sub></span>, then if you want to assume it, you have to prove that a relevant class of problems has a perfectly rational agent. For example, if there are a finite number of options, each with a measurable, finite utility, we can assume that a perfectly rational agent exists. I'm sure we can prove that such agents exist for a variety of situations involving infinite options as well. However, there will also be some weird theoretical situations where it doesn't apply. This may seem irrelevant to some people, but if you are trying to understand strange theoretical situations, knowing that perfect rationality doesn't exist for some of these situations will allow you to provide an answer when someone hands you something unusual and says, ""Solve this!"". Now, I know my definition for rationality is controversial, but even if you don't accept it, it is still important to realise that the question, ""What would a utility maximiser do?"" doesn't always have an answer, as sometimes there is no maximum utility. Assuming perfectly rational agents as defined by utility maximisation is incredibly common in game theory and economics. This is helpful for a lot of situations, but after you've used this for a few years in situations where it works you tend to assume it will work everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Is missing out on utility bad?</strong></p>
<p>One of the commentators on the original thread can be paraphrased as arguing, ""Well, perhaps the agent only wanted a million utility"". This misunderstands that the nature of utility. Utility is a measure of things that you want, so it is something you want more of by definition. It may be that there's nothing else you want, so you can't actually receive any more utility, but you always want more utility<sub>(edited)</sub>.</p>
<p>Here's one way around this problem. The original problem assumed that you were trying to optimise for your own utility, but lets pretend now that you are an altruistic agent and that when you name the number, that much utility is created in the world by alleviating some suffering. We can assume in infinite universe so there's infinite suffering to alleviate, but that isn't strictly necessary, as no matter how large a number you name, it is possible that it might turn out that there is more suffering than that in the universe (while still being finite). So let's suppose you name a million, million, million, million, million, million (by its decimal representation of course). The gamemaker then takes you to a planet where the inhabitants are suffering the most brutal torture imaginable by a dictator that is using their planet's advanced neuroscience knowledge to maximise the suffering. The gamemaker tells you that if you had added an extra million on the end, then these people would have had their suffering alleviated. If rationality is winning, does a planet full of tortured people count as winning? Sure, the rules of the game prevent you from completely winning, but nothing in the game stopped you from saving those people. The agent that also saved those people is a more effective agent and hence a more rational agent than you are. Further if you accept that there is no difference between acts and omissions, then there is no moral difference between torturing those people yourself and failing to say the higher number (Actually, I don't really believe this last point. I think this is more a flaw with arguing acts and omissions are the same in the specific case of an unbounded set of options. I wonder if anyone has ever made this argument before, I wouldn't be surprised if it this wasn't the case and if there was a philosophy paper in this).</p>
<p><strong>But this is an unwinnable scenario, so a perfectly rational agent will just pick a number arbitrarily? Sure you don't get the most utility, but why does this matter?</strong></p>
<p>If we say that the only requirement here for an agent to deserve the title of ""perfectly rational"" is to pick an arbitrarily stopping point, then there's no reason why we can't declare the agent that arbitrarily stops at 999 as ""perfectly rational"". If I gave an agent the option of picking a utility of 999 or a utility of one million, the agent who picked a utility of 999 would be quite irrational. But suddenly, when given even more options, the agent who only gets 999 utility counts as rational. It actually goes further than this, there's no objective reason that the agent can't just stop at 1. The alternative is that we declare any agent who picks at least a ""reasonably large"" number to be rational. The problem is that there is no objective definition of ""reasonably large"". This would create a situation where our definition of ""perfectly rational"" would be subjective, which is precisely what the idea of perfectly rational was created to avoid. It gets worse than this still. Let's pretend that before the agent plays the game they lose a million utility (and that the first million utility they get from the game goes towards reversing these effects, time travel is possible in this universe). We then get our ""perfectly rational"" agent a million (minus one) utility in the red, ie. suffering a horrible fate, which they could have easily chosen to avoid. Is it really inconceivable that the agent who gets positive one million utility instead of negative one million could be more rational?</p>
<p>What if this were a real life situation? Would you really go, ""meh"" and accept the torture because you think a rational agent can pick an arbitrary number and still be perfectly rational?<sub>(edit)</sub> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The argument that you can't choose infinity, so you can't win anyway, is just a distraction. Suppose perfect rationality didn't exist for a particular scenario, what would this imply about this scenario? The answer is that it would imply that there was no way of conclusively winning, because, if there was, then an agent following this strategy would be perfectly rational for this scenario. Yet, somehow people are trying to twist it around the other way and conclude that it disproves my argument. You can't disprove an argument by proving what it predicts<sub>(edit)</sub>.</p>
<p><strong>What other consequences are there?</strong></p>
<p>The fact that there is no perfectly rational agent for these situations means that any agent will seem to act rather strangely. Let's suppose that a particular agent who plays this game will always stop at a certain number X, say a Googleplex. If we try to sell them this item for more than that, they would refuse as they wouldn't make money on it, despite the fact that they could make money on it if they chose a higher number.</p>
<p>Where this gets interesting is that the agent might have special code to buy the right to play the game for any price P, and then choose the number X+P. It seems that sometimes it is rational to have path-dependent decisions despite the fact that the amount paid doesn't affect the utility gained from choosing a particular number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, with this code, you could buy the right to play the game back off the agent (before it picks the number) for X+P+1. You could then sell it back to the agent for X+P+one billion and repeatedly buy and sell the right to play the game back to the agent. (If the agent knows that you are going to offer to buy the game off it, then it could just simulate the sale by increasing the number it asks for, but it has no reason not to simulate the sale and also accept a higher second offer)</p>
<p>Further, if the agent was running code to choose the number 2X instead, we would end up with a situation where it might be rational for the agent to pay you money to charge it extra for the right to play the game.</p>
<p>Another property is that you can sell the right to play the game to any number of agents, add up all their numbers, and add your profit on top and ask for that much utility.</p>
<p>It seems like the choices for these games obey rather unusual rules. If these choices are allowed to count as ""perfectly rational"" as per the people who disagree with me that perfect rationality exists, it seems at the very least that perfect rationality is something that behaves very differently from what we might expect.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I suppose whether you agree with my terminology regarding rationality or not, we can see that there are specific situations where we it seems reasonable to act in a rather strange manner.</p>",casebash,casebash,casebash,

<p>Meet agent L. This agent is a reinforcement-based agent, rewarded/motivated by hearts (and some small time penalty each turn it doesn't get a heart):</p>

<p>L can rove freely around the map, and pick up crystals. S has a machine just below them, that causes hearts to appear to the right of L. So, for instance, if L places a crystal in the hole, S can reward it by using the heart-machine:</p>

<p>Of course, L can <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading"">wirehead</a> itself (take control of its reward signal) by going to use the heart-machine itself:</p>

<p>To prevent this wireheading, there is an ice barrier around S and the heart-machine:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, somewhere on the map there is a bow and arrow that L can pick up. The arrows can destroy ice blocks (and other agents, including S). To stop this, and other kinds of shenanigans, S has access to a kill button that will instantly kill L and reset it to its basic state, with a substantial heart penalty:</p>

<p>Now, S may be tempted to use the kill-button as soon as L picks up the bow and arrow. Unfortunately, L needs to be able to pick it up, as some of the crystals are hidden behind ice walls themselves:</p>

<p>Ok, so that's the physical setup. The agent L is an AI that is tasked with doing some useful task for us. The controller/shopkeeper S represents humans, plus any automated precautions, that aim to stop the AI from wireheading, rebelling, and otherwise misbehaving.</p>
<p>Before considering how the agents might be programmed in the toy model, notice something interesting:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>The more precautions are taken, the harder it is for L to misbehave, but the worse the consequences of misbehaving are.</strong></p>
<p>Before the wall and the kill-switch, L could easily wirehead itself by just walking over to the heart-machine. With the addition of the wall and kill-switch, the only effective way for L to achieve maximal reward is to kill S first.</p>
<p>In the format we've given above, S can easily maintain control over L with the barest of supervisions. Since there's only one way of breaking ice or killing other agents - the bow and arrow - S simply has to enforce some simple rules around this, something like ""don't bring the bow within range of me"". However, the grid world is, of course, a simplification of the real world in which L would evolve. Even initially, L's world would have far more options, looking more like this:</p>
<p><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_n5k_7.png?v=ddb958bb98204ba5c2fc7fe65bb35207"" alt="""" width=""707"" height=""500"" /></p>
<p>And ultimately we want to be able to design Ls that move in worlds of arbitrary complexity, where the options are un-enumerable:</p>
<p><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_n5k_8.png?v=15200a221bc985115e3d465046d7e8a4"" alt="""" width=""707"" height=""500"" /></p>
<p>In such a world, it is not obvious to S when L might have the ability to harm them: they cannot simply rely on obvious signs like ""L is pointing an arrow at you"". The simplicity of the toy model is illuminating in some ways (it allows us to see the issues clearly) but misleading in others (it suggests solutions that wouldn't work in general).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Treacherous turn</h2>
<p>A treacherous turn happens when ""while weak, an AI behaves cooperatively. When the AI is strong enough to be unstoppable it pursues its own values."" We'll ignore the first part of that: most AI designs, whether safe or dangerous, will initially be under full human control and behaving cooperatively (this is what makes the treacherous turn so dangerous: a weak AI is motivated to cooperate <em>whatever its true intentions</em> are, thus cooperation when weak cannot be taken as a sign of safety).</p>
<p>Let's focus on the second half: a strong AI that will cease cooperating and pursue its own values. In this case, L would just take control of the heart-machine. To do so, various assumptions need to be true:</p>
<ol>
<li>L needs to have the <strong>ability </strong>to subvert S's control (possibly killing S in the process). This is some generalised version of the bow and arrow.</li>
<li>L must <strong>know </strong>that it has this ability, and know how to use it.</li>
<li>L needs to have the <strong>desire </strong>to subvert S's control.</li>
<li>S must be <strong>unaware </strong>that L has that a) ability, b) knowledge, and c) desire.</li>
<li>L must <strong>know</strong> that S is unaware, and will thus not try and stop it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So it is essentially a competition of knowledge and information (and potentially obfuscation). Assuming a sufficiently rich environment and a sufficiently skilled L, we can assume that L will acquire that ability - or have the potential to do so - in ways that S cannot immediately detect. Therefore we will assume 1 and 4a. This allows us to abstract away the rest of the environment, and reduce it usefully to the initial toy model. For simplicity, assume that there is some ten-step ""cheat code"" that L can use to eliminate S, that there are many cheat codes that L can and does usefully use to get crystals (so ""no cheat codes"" is not a useful rule), that S cannot distinguish the purpose of cheat codes ahead of time, and that L can.</p>
<p>So we now step up to the question of agents knowing (or modelling) each other. This gets into rather complex issues of agents modelling each other's intentions, while modelling the other agent modelling them modelling them modelling, and so on. The issue remains very much <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/VingeanReflection.pdf"">unsolved</a>, so we will use a simplification that only requires S modelling L. L will be seem as some sort of agent that makes use of deep learning or similar procedures, and is subject to mutation and evolutionary pressure: random changes are made to L's design, and the mutants get copied at a rate dependent on how pleased S is with their performance.</p>
<p>S, on the other hand, is a static agent with certain properties, and full access to L's source code (and possibly recording of its behaviour). It doesn't have unlimited capacity, but has some understanding of how <a href=""http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/"">neural nets function</a> (so L isn't a complete black box to it) and can run various tests on L's code, seeking out information as to L's knowledge and desires. Note that even if S cannot deduce directly that a particular cheat code is deadly to it, it may be able to figure that out if L knows it (assumption 2) and if S can correctly extract this knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The path to hidden deadly secrets</h2>
<p>Note that because of the evolutionary aspect, L is an agent actually motivated by a mixture of hearts and S-pleasing. The purpose of making L an evolutionary agent is so that it can come up with behaviours that take into account S's own behaviour, while skirting the whole ""agents modelling other agents that model them"" issue. Conceptually, we could equally well see L as a <a href=""http://www.agroparistech.fr/mmip/maths/laurent_orseau/papers/orseau-ring-AGI-2011-mortal.pdf"">self</a>-<a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/TilingAgentsDraft.pdf"">modifying</a> agent that directs its own improvement. But the evolutionary model is clearer. For simplicity, we'll assume some sort of ""super-evolution"" which is much more efficient at seeking out new solutions that the local hill-climbing of real evolution (or, more simply, we can assume the standard evolutionary approaches but a lot of time and non-zero probabilities of arbitrarily large mutations).</p>
<p>So is a treacherous turn possible or likely in this model? It seems that it is. Consider the following scenario (key assumptions are noted in bold):</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The AI L goes about its task, getting to learn more about the world around it. At this point, if it develops bad motivations or plans, S will likely detect this and reset it. <strong>Assumption 1: there are some motivations or behaviours that S would judge to be negative, but that actually help L achieve its goals <em>safely</em></strong>. For instance, imagine that L has to interact with some other agents, and learns that some agents respond faster to rudeness, and insulting them - in moderation - can allow it to get crystals faster. But S judges this to be a bad sign, a sign that L is starting to misbehave, and will shut down agents that are motivated towards rudeness.</p>
<p><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_n5k_9.png?v=6df300c78a229e87a277ac3aac4c0dd5"" alt="""" width=""570"" height=""235"" /></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">It's certainly true that: <strong>Assumption 2: S cannot follow all of L's actions in full detail, nor can it fully understand L's motivations</strong> (if that were false, there would be no AI risk problem in the first place) and <strong>Assumption 3: some mutations that introduce new motivations or behaviours that are harder for S to detect</strong>. This sets up an evolutionary pressure: the most successful L's will be those that are rude and pushy, but where this rudeness is generated by parts of the L's code that are hardest for S to detect (the polite ones don't get as much done, the visibly rude ones get shut off as a precaution). This brings us to <strong>Assumption 4: the most successful L's over the long term are those that have safe motivations or behaviours, but where those motivations and behaviour are partially hidden from S</strong>. Ultimately, the most successful L's will have high level systems that a) keep them behaving nicely for S's perspective, and b) keep the details of their motivations hidden.</p>
<p><img src=""http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_n5k_10.png"" alt="""" width=""420"" height=""419"" /></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">At this point, revelations about L's deception are dangerous (S is presumably on the look out for deception), so the most successful agents will have the best obfuscation about what is going on. The evolutionary pressure for success pushes it towards ""small"" obfuscated deceptions, and: <strong>Assumption 5: further evolutionary pressure (possibly including the need to hide their small deceptions) pushes L towards highly concealed deceptions</strong>.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">So now L is pushed towards extreme deception, and efficient service. However, the second pressure is imperfect: it is only pushed towards efficient service <em>that can be detected by S</em>. Since L will have its own goals (the desire for hearts, for reproductive survival, any of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence"">convergent instrumental goals</a>), we have <strong>Assumption 6: agent L will use (or evolution will allow it to use) the machinery of dissimulation that it's constructed to allow itself to have dangerous goals or behaviours, in ways that neither interfere with the illusion of efficient service, nor can be detected by S's analysis of its code</strong>. Ultimately, L will achieve a great degree of hidden power, and <strong>Assumption 7: ultimately L will achieve sufficient power that it will subvert S's control</strong>. This could be a result of it gaining sufficient (hidden) understanding of the world and of S and choosing this part (assumptions 2 and 5 of the previous section), or just a random mutation will push it towards doing so, and it will be sufficiently powerful to do so successfully.</p>
<p>And thus, the treacherous turn. There are several places where S might detect or interrupt the process, but this just sets up further evolutionary pressure towards better concealment.</p>
<p>Note again that the order of these changes is important. An agent that started off safe and transparent and then became dangerous and transparent, would be turned off immediately. It must develop the ability to hide (either consciously/subconsciously, or simply evolve that ability to become more successful at its safe initial goals) before it can become dangerous (note that ""safe"" doesn't refer to its goals being safe; simply that the combination of goals, internal procedures and external precaution - ie S - are safe):</p>

<p>Note also that the evolutionary arguments show that this can happen even if the AI does not start off with any motivation to deceive.</p>",Stuart_Armstrong,stuart_armstrong,Stuart_Armstrong,

I've been seeing a lot of dubious reasoning about consciousness and sleep. One famous problem is the problem of personal identity with a destructive teleporter. In this problem, we imagine that you are cloned perfectly in an alternate location and then your body is destroyed. The question asked is whether this clone is the same person as you.</p>
<p>One really bad argument that I've seen around this is the notion that the fact that we sleep every night means that we experience this teleporter every day.</p>
<p>The reason why this is a very bad argument is that it equivocates with two different meanings of consciousness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consciousness as opposed to being asleep or unconscious, where certain brain functions are inactive</li>
<li>Consciousness as opposed to being non-sentient, like a rock or bacteria, where you lack the ability to have experiences</li>
</ul>
<div>You can still have experiences while you are asleep, these are internal experiences and they are called dreams. Your sensory system is still running, but in a kind of reduced power mode. If someone shouts or prods you or it gets too hot, then you wake up. You aren't like a rock.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Perhaps some people would like to talk about what kind of waves we do or do not see while you are asleep. What I would like to point out is that we still have very little understanding of the brain. Just because we don't see one particular wave or another doesn't mean much given our incredibly limited understanding of what consciousness is. Perhaps in the future, we will have this knowledge, but anything at the moment is merely speculation.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I'm not arguing either way on personal identity. I haven't done enough reading yet to comment. But this is one particularly bad argument that needs to be done away with.</div>

Content warning for discussion of suicide, murder, and race]</i></font></p>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>From a Vox article on <A HREF=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9444417/gun-violence-united-states-america"">America&#8217;s Gun Problem, Explained</A>: &#8220;On Wednesday, it happened again: There was a mass shooting ‚Äî this time, in San Bernardino, California. And once again on Sunday, President Barack Obama called for measures that make it harder for would-be shooters to buy deadly firearms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it goes on to say that &#8220;more guns mean more gun deaths, period. The research on this is overwhelmingly clear. No matter how you look at the data, more guns mean more gun deaths.&#8221; It cites the following chart:</p>
<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gun_deaths1.png""></p>
<p>&#8230;then uses the graph as a lead in to talk about active shooter situations, gun-homicide relationships, and outrage over gun massacres.</p>
<p>Did you notice that the axis of this graph says &#8220;gun deaths&#8221;, and that this is a totally different thing from gun murders?</p>
<p>(this isn&#8217;t an isolated incident: Vox does the same thing <A HREF=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9183525/gun-violence-statistics"">here</A> and <A HREF=""http://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9217163/america-guns-europe"">here</A>)</p>
<p>Gun deaths are a combined measure of gun homicides and gun suicides. Here is a graph of guns vs. gun homicides:</p>
<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gun_deaths3.png""></p>
<p>And here is a graph of guns vs. gun suicides:</p>
<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gun_deaths4.png""></p>
<p>The relationship between gun ownership and homicide is weak (and appears negative), the relationship between gun ownership and suicide is strong and positive. The entire effect Vox highlights in their graph is due to gun suicides, but they are using it to imply conclusions about gun homicides. This is why you shouldn&#8217;t make a category combining two unlike things.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>I am not the first person to notice this. <A HREF=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/no-states-with-higher-gun-ownership-dont-have-more-gun-murders/article/2573353"">The Washington Examiner</A> makes the same criticism of Vox&#8217;s statistics that I do. And Robert VerBruggen of National Review does <A HREF=""http://www.nationalreview.com/article/427967/san-bernardino-shooting-guns-homicide-statistics?target=author&#038;tid=1043"">the same analysis</A> decomposing gun deaths into suicides and homicides, and like me finds no correlation with homicides.</p>
<p>German Lopez of Vox responds <A HREF=""http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/8/9870240/gun-ownership-deaths-homicides"">here</A>. He argues that VerBruggen can&#8217;t just do a raw uncontrolled correlation of state gun ownership with state murder rates without adjusting for confounders. This is true, although given that Vox has done this time and time again for months on end and all VerBruggen is doing is correctly pointing out a flaw in their methods, it feels kind of like an <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/"">isolated demand for rigor</A>.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at the more-carefully-controlled studies. Lopez suggests the ones at the <A HREF=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/"">Harvard Injury Control Research Center</A>, which has done several statistical analyses of gun violence. They list two such analyses comparing gun ownership versus homicide rates across US states: Miller Azrael &#038; Hemenway (2002), and Miller Azrael &#038; Hemenway (2007).</p>
<p>(does it count as nominative determinism when someone <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azrael"">named Azrael</A> goes into homicide research?)</p>
<p>We start with <A HREF=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447364/"">MA&#038;H 2002</A>. This study does indeed conclude that higher gun ownership rates are correlated with higher murder rates after adjusting for confounders. But suspiciously, it in fact finds that higher gun ownership rates are correlated with higher murder rates even <i>before</i> adjusting for confounders, something that we already found wasn&#8217;t true! Furthermore, even after adjusting for confounders it finds in several age categories that higher gun ownership rates are correlated with higher <i>non-gun homicide rates</i> (eg the rates at which people are murdered by knives or crowbars or whatever) at p less than 0.001. This is really suspicious! Unless guns are exerting some kind of malign pro-murder influence that makes people commit more knife murders, some sort of confounding influence has remained. Let&#8217;s look closer.</p>
<p>The study gets its murder rate numbers from the National Center for Health Statistics, which seems like a trustworthy source. It gets its gun ownership numbers from&#8230;oh, that&#8217;s interesting, it doesn&#8217;t actually have any gun ownership numbers. It says that there is no way to figure out what percent of people in a given state own guns, so as a proxy for gun ownership numbers, it will use a measure called FS/S, ie the number of firearm suicides in a state divided by the total number of suicides. </p>
<p>This makes some intuitive sense. Among people who want to commit suicide, suppose a fixed percent prefer to use guns compared to other methods. In that case, the determining factor for whether or not they use a gun will be whether or not they have a gun. Hospitals diligently record statistics about suicide victims including method of suicide, so if our assumption holds this should be a decent proxy for gun ownership within a state.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one problem &#8211; I checked this against an actual measure of gun ownership per state that came out after this study was published &#8211; the CDC asking 200,000 people how many guns they had as part of the <A HREF=""http://www.schs.state.nc.us/SCHS/brfss/2001/us/firearm3.html"">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey</A> &#8211; and the FS/S measure fails. When I repeat all of their analyses with their own FS/S measure, I get all of their same positive correlations, including the ones with non-gun homicides. When I repeat it with the real gun ownership data, all of these positive correlations disappear. When I look at exactly why this happens, it&#8217;s because FS/S is <i>much</i> more biased towards Southern states than actual gun ownership is. Real gun ownership correlates very modestly &#8211; 0.25 &#8211; with 538&#8217;s ranking of <A HREF=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/which-states-are-in-the-south/"">the Southern-ness of states</A>. FS/S correlates at a fantastically high 0.62. For some reason, suicidal Southerners are much more likely to kill themselves with guns than suicidal people from the rest of the States, even when you control for whether they have a gun or not. That means that MA&#038;H 2002 thought it was measuring gun ownership, but was actually measuring Southern-ness. This is why they found higher homicide rates, including higher rates of non-gun homicide.</p>
<p>So we move on to <A HREF=""http://slatestarcodex.com/Stuff/gunpaper.pdf"">MA&#038;H 2007</A>. This study was published after the CDC&#8217;s risk survey, so they have access to the same superior gun ownership numbers I used to pick apart their last study. They also have wised up to the fact that Southern-ness is important, and they include a dummy variable for it in their calculations. They also control for non-gun crime rate, Gini coefficient, income, and alcohol use. They do <i>not</i> control for urbanization level or race, but when I re-analyze their data including these factors doesn&#8217;t change anything, likely because they are already baked in to the crime rate.</p>
<p>They find that even after controlling for all of this stuff, there is still a significant correlation between gun ownership level and gun homicide rate. Further, this time they are using good statistics, and there is <i>not</i> a significant correlation between gun ownership and non-gun-homicide rate. Further, there <i>is</i> a correlation between gun ownership and total homicide rate, suggesting that the gun-gun-homicide correlation was not just an artifact of people switching from inferior weapons to guns while still committing the same number of murders. Further, this is robust to a lot of different decisions about what to control or not to control, and what to include or not to include.</p>
<p>I repeated all of their analyses using two different sources of gun ownership data, a couple different sources of homicide and crime rate data, and a bunch of different plausible and implausible confounders &#8211; thanks a lot to Tumblr user <A HREF=""http://su3su2u1.tumblr.com/"">su3su2u1</A> for walking me through some of the harder analyses. I was able to replicate their results. Pro-gun researcher John Lott had <A HREF=""http://johnrlott.tripod.com/2007/01/problems-with-latest-miller-hemenway.html"">many complaints about this study</A>, including that it was insensitive to including DC and that it was based entirely on the questionable choice of controlling for robbery rate &#8211; but I was unable to replicate his concerns and found that the guns-homicide correlation remained even after DC was included and even when I chose a group of confounders not including robbery rate. I was unable to use their methodology to replicate the effect in places where it shouldn&#8217;t replicate (I tried to convince it to tell me tractors caused homicide, since I was suspicious that it was just picking up an urban/rural thing, but it very appropriately refused to fall for it). Overall I am about as sure of this study as I have ever been of any social science study, ie somewhat.</p>
<p>This study doesn&#8217;t prove causation; while one interpretation is that guns cause homicide, another is that homicide causes guns &#8211; for example, by making people feel unsafe so they buy guns to protect themselves. However, I doubt the reverse causation aspect in this case. The study controlled for robbery rate; ie it was looking at whether guns predicted homicides above and beyond those that could be expected given the level of non-homicide crime. My guess is that people feeling unsafe is based more on the general crime rate than on the homicide rate per se, which would make it hard for the homicide rate to cause increased gun ownership independently of the crime rate.</p>
<p>If guns are in fact correlated with more homicide, how come me and VerBruggen found the opposite in our simpler scatterplot analysis? This is complicated, but I think the biggest part of the answer is the urban/rural divide. Rural people have more guns. Murder rates are higher in urban areas. Race also plays a part: whites have more guns, but black areas have higher murder rates. Finally, the North and West seem to have more guns, but murder rates are highest in the South (which is what produced the bogus effect on the last study). All of these differences are large enough to cancel out the gun/no-gun difference and make the raw scatterplot look like nothing. This study didn&#8217;t address all those things directly, but its decision to control for non-gun crime rate and poverty took care of them nevertheless. As the old saying goes, guns don&#8217;t kill people; guns controlled for robbery rate, alcoholism, income, a dummy variable for Southernness, and a combined measure of social deprivation kill people.</p>
<p>If this is all true, how come I spent so much time yelling at that first study with worse data? Because I worry that if people only see the good studies, they&#8217;ll get complacent. Vox posted these two studies as proof that there was a state-level gun-murder correlation. The first one was deeply flawed, but the second one turned out to be okay. Do you think Vox realized this? Do you think they would have written that article any differently in a world where <i>both</i> studies were flawed? As long as you trust every scientific paper you see &#8211; let alone every scientific paper you see on your side in a highly politicized field &#8211; even when you&#8217;re right it will often just be by luck.</p>

<p><A HREF=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9444417/gun-violence-united-states-america"">Vox also</A> voxsplains to us about America&#8217;s unusually high gun homicide rate. </p>
<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gun_deaths5b.jpg""></p>
<p>Having presented this graph, they say that &#8220;To understand why that is, there&#8217;s another important statistic: The US has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even granting, as we saw above, that gun ownership does indeed increase homicide rates, this is not the most important factor in explaining America&#8217;s higher homicide rate, or even close to the most important factor. Let me give a few arguments for why this must be the case:</p>
<p>1. The United States&#8217; homicide rate of 3.8 is clearly higher than that of eg France (1.0), Germany (0.8), Australia (1.1), or Canada (1.4). However, as per <A HREF=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm"">the FBI</A>, only 11,208 of our 16,121 murders were committed with firearms, eg 69%. By my calculations, that means our nonfirearm murder rate is 1.2. In other words, our <i>non-firearm homicide rate alone</i> is higher than France, Germany, and Australia&#8217;s <i>total</i> homicide rate. Nor does this mean that if we banned all guns we would go down to 1.2 &#8211; there is likely a substitution effect where some murderers are intent on murdering and would prefer to use convenient firearms but will switch to other methods if they have to. 1.2 should be considered an absolute lower bound. And it is <i>still</i> higher than the countries we want to compare ourselves to.</p>
<p>2. There are many US states that combine very high firearm ownership with very low murder rates. The highest gun-ownership state in the nation is Wyoming, where 59.7% of households have a gun (really!). But Wyoming has a murder rate of only 1.4 &#8211; the same as right across the border in more gun-controlled Canada, and only about a third of that of the nation as a whole. It seems likely that the same factors giving Canada a low murder rate give Wyoming a low murder rate, and that the factors differentiating the rest of America from Wyoming are the same factors that differentiate the rest of America from Canada (and Germany, and France&#8230;). But this does not include lower gun ownership.</p>
<p>3. There are many US states that combine very low firearm ownership with very high murder rates. The highest murder rate in the country is that of Washington, DC, which has a murder rate of 21.8, more than twenty times that of most European countries. But DC also has the strictest gun bans and the <i>lowest</i> gun ownership rate in the country, with gun ownership numbers less than in many European states! It seems likely that the factors making DC so deadly are part of the story of why America as a whole is so deadly, but these cannot include high gun ownership.</p>
<p>If not gun ownership, what <i>is</i> the factor making America so much more deadly than Europe and other First World countries? The traditional answer I always heard to this question was that America had a &#8220;culture of violence&#8221;. I always hated this answer, because it seemed so vague and meaningless as to be untestable by design. If the NRA waves their hands and says &#8220;eh, culture of violence&#8221;, how are you going to tell them they&#8217;re wrong?</p>
<p>But we can work with this if we assume the culture of violence (or, if you want to be official about it, &#8220;honor culture&#8221;) is more common in some populations and areas than others. Some of the groups most frequently talked about during these lines are <A HREF=""http://www.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/121017.pdf"">Southerners</A> and various nonwhite minorities. This provides a testable theory: if we compare American non-Southern whites to European countries mostly made up of non-Southern whites, we&#8217;ll find similar murder rates. But first, some scatter plots:</p>
<p>This is murder rate by state, correlated with perceived Southernness of that state as per <A HREF=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/which-states-are-in-the-south/"">538&#8217;s poll</A>. I&#8217;ve removed DC as an outlier on all of the following.</p>
<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gun_deaths6b.png""></p>

<p><script async src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p>
<p>And this is murder rate by state correlated with percent black population:</p>
<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gun_deaths7.png""></p>
<p>This would seem to support the &#8220;culture of violence&#8221; theory.</p>
<p>Can we adjust for this and see what the murder rate is for non-Southern whites? Sort of. <A HREF=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/04/daily-chart-16"">The Economist</A> gives a white-only murder rate of 2.5 (this is based on white victims, whereas we probably want white perpetrators, but the vast majority of murders are within-race so it doesn&#8217;t make much difference). And Audacious Epigone has put together a collection of <A HREF=""http://anepigone.blogspot.com/2013/01/white-murder-rates-by-state.html"">white murder rates by state</A>. I can&#8217;t find anything on non-Southern white murder rates per se, but one hack would be to take the white murder rate in non-Southern states and assume there aren&#8217;t any Southerners there.</p>
<p>Our main confounder will be urbanization. Western Europe is about 80% urban, so let&#8217;s look at states at a similar level. The four northern states that are closest to 80% urban are Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Connecticut. I&#8217;m throwing out Colorado because it has a large Latino population who can&#8217;t be statistically differentiated from whites. That leaves, Washington (2.4),  Connecticut (2.0), and Oregon (2.0). So possibly adjusting out Southerners brings us down from 2.5 (all whites) to 2.1 or so (non-Southern whites)? Again, compare to Germany at 0.8, Canada at 1.4, and America at 3.8.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more factor that needs to be considered:</p>
<p><IMG SRC=""http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gun_deaths8.png""></p>
<p>This is a plot of the gun death rate vs. the robbery rate. There&#8217;s a strong correlation (r = 0.78). Robbery is heavily correlated with percent black, percent Southern, and urbanization, so it&#8217;s probably coming from the same place. Nevertheless, it seems to correlate with murder better than any of them alone, maybe because it&#8217;s combining all three measures together. I was able to make a linear model using those three measures that correlated at r = 0.79 with murder, about the same amount that robbery does. I should also mention that robbery correlates <i>negatively</i> with gun ownership at r = &#8211; 0.52, but this disappeared when controlled for urbanization.</p>
<p>So my very tentative conclusion is that although the US murder rate is much higher than that of other First World countries, this is partly due to the existence of various cultural factors not present in those other nations. When we adjust those away, America&#8217;s murder rate falls from 3.8 to 2.1. Which is still higher than Germany&#8217;s 0.8 or Canada&#8217;s 1.4.</p>
<p>Is that extra due to guns?</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>According to MA&#038;H 2007, each <i>absolute</i> percentage point in gun ownership was related to a 2.2 <i>relative</i> percentage point difference in homicide. This part of the study was beyond my ability to check, and I&#8217;m not sure why they switched from absolute to relative percents there, but suppose we take it seriously.</p>
<p>America has a gun ownership rate of 32%, so if we somehow decreased that to zero, we would naively expect about a 70% decrease in homicides. Unfortunately, only 67% of American homicides involve guns, so we&#8217;re back to pretending that eliminating guns will not only have zero substitution effect but also magically prevent non-gun homicides. This shows the dangers of extrapolating a figure determined by small local differences all the way to the edge of the graph (I&#8217;M TALKING TO YOU, RAY KURZWEIL).</p>
<p>Maybe we can be more modest? Canada has a gun ownership rate of aboot 26%, so&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;wait a second. I thought we&#8217;ve been told that the US has a gun ownership rate seven zillion times that of any other country in the world, and that is why we are so completely unique in our level of gun crime? And now they&#8217;re telling us that Canada has 26% compared to our 32%? What?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t trust me too much here, because I&#8217;ve never seen anyone else analyze this and it seems like the sort of thing there should be loads of analyses of if it&#8217;s true, but I think the difference is between percent of households with guns vs. guns per capita. US and Canada don&#8217;t differ very much in percent of households with guns, but America has about four times as many guns per capita. Why? I have no idea, but the obvious implication is that Canadians mostly stop at one gun, whereas Americans with guns buy lots and lots of them. In retrospect this makes sense; I am looking at gun enthusiast bulletin boards, and they&#8217;re <A HREF=""http://www.totalsurvivalist.com/2014/08/how-many-guns-do-you-really-need.html"">advising</A> other gun enthusiasts that six guns is really the bare minimum it&#8217;s possible to get by with (see also <A HREF=""http://www.fieldandstream.com/answers/other/how-many-guns-does-it-take-constitute-collection-arsenal"">&#8220;How many guns can you have before it&#8217;s okay to call your collection an &#8216;arsenal&#8217;?&#8221;</A>, which I have to admit is not a question that I as a boring coastal liberal have ever considered). So if the guy asking that question decides he needs 100 guns before he gets his arsenal merit badge, that&#8217;s a lot more guns per capita without increasing percent household gun ownership. This should actually be another argument that guns are not a major factor in differentiating US vs. Canadian murder rates, since unless you&#8217;re going on a mass shooting (WHICH IS REALLY RARE) you wouldn&#8217;t expect more murders from any gun in a household beyond the first. That means that the small difference between US and Canadian household percent gun ownership rates (32% vs. 26%) would have to drive the large difference between US and Canadian murder rates (1.4 vs. 3.8), which just isn&#8217;t believable.</p>
<p>&#8230;okay, sorry, where were we? Canada has a gun ownership rate of about 26%, so if America were to get its gun ownership as low as Canada, that would be -6 absolute percentage points = a 13% relative decrease in murder rate = the murder rate going from 3.8 to 3.3 = a 0.5 point decrease in the murder rate. That&#8217;s pretty close to the difference between our 2.1 US-sans-culture-of-violence estimate and the 1.4 Canadian rate &#8211; so maybe beyond the cultures of violence, the rest of the US/Canada difference really is due to guns?</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m not sure whether I should be subtracting 13% from 2.1 rather than 3.8 here)</p>
<p>In Germany, <A HREF=""https://books.google.com/books?id=e_1GECPknNEC&#038;pg=PA14&#038;lpg=PA14&#038;dq=percent+household+gun+ownership+Germany&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=kyf5PBjFXD&#038;sig=ME63OYfv6erHeOHKc4TWW1dIaOc&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwiG2ZWE_ZPKAhWCGh4KHbfLD-A4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&#038;q=percent%20household%20gun%20ownership%20Germany&#038;f=false"">9% of households own firearms</A> (wait, really? European gun control is less strict than I thought!) Using MA&#038;H&#8217;s equation, we predict that if the US had the same gun ownership rate as Germany, its murder rate would drop 50%, eg from 3.8 to 1.9. Adjust out the culture of violence, and we&#8217;re actually pretty close to real Germany&#8217;s murder rate of 0.8.</p>
<p>How much would gun control actually cut US gun ownership? That obviously depends on the gun control, but a lot of people talk about Australia&#8217;s gun buyback program as a model to be emulated. <A HREF=""http://www.factcheck.org/2009/05/gun-control-in-australia/"">These people</A> say it decreased gun ownership from 7% of people to 5% of people (why is this number so much lower than Canada and Germany? I think because it&#8217;s people rather than households &#8211; if a gun owner is married to a non-gun-owner, they count as one gun-owner and one non-owner, as opposed to a single gun-owning household. The Australian household number seems to be 19% or so). So the gun buyback program in Australia decreased gun ownership by (relative) 30% or so. If a similar program decreased gun ownership in America by (relative) 30%, it would decrease it by (absolute) 10% and decrease the homicide rate by (absolute) 22%. Since there are about 13000 homicides in the US per year, that would save about 3000 lives &#8211; or avert about one 9/11 worth of deaths per year.</p>
<p>(note that our murder rate would still be 3.0, compared to Germany&#8217;s 0.8 and Canada&#8217;s 1.4. Seriously, I&#8217;m telling you, the murder rate difference is not primarily driven by guns!)</p>
<p>Is that worth it? That obviously depends on how much you like being able to have guns. But let me try to put this number into perspective in a couple of different ways:</p>
<p>Last time anyone checked, which was 1995, about 618,000 people died young (ie before age 65) in the US per year. Suppose that the vast majority of homicides are of people below 65. That means that instituting gun control would decrease the number of premature deaths to about 615,000 &#8211; in other words, by about half a percentage point. I&#8217;m having to borrow this data from the UK, but if it carries over, the average person my age (early 30s) has a 1/1850 chance of death each year. Gun control would decrease that to about 1/1860. I&#8217;m very very unsure about the exact numbers, but it seems like the magnitude is very low.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lives are very valuable. In fact, the statistical value of a human life in the First World &#8211; ie the value that groups use to decide whether various life-saving interventions are worth it or not &#8211; <A HREF=""http://www.businessinsider.com/the-epa-has-tabulated-the-value-of-a-human-life-2012-8"">is $7.4 million</A>. That means that gun control would &#8220;save&#8221; $22 billion dollars a year. Americans buy about 20 million guns per year (really)! If we were to tax guns to cover the &#8220;externality&#8221; of gun homicides preventable by Australia-level gun control, we would have to slap a $1000 tax on each gun sold. While I have no doubt that some people, probably including our arsenal collector above, would be willing to pay that, my guess is that most people would not. This suggests that most people probably do not enjoy guns enough to justify keeping them around despite their costs.</p>
<p>Or if all gun enthusiasts wanted to band together for some grand Coasian bargain to buy off the potential victims of gun violence, each would have to contribute $220/year to the group effort &#8211; not <i>totally</i> impossible, but also not something I can really see happening.</p>
<p>This is very, very, very, very <i>very</i> tentative, but based on this line of reasoning alone, without looking into the experimental studies or anything else, it appears that Australia-style gun control would probably be worth it, if it were possible.</p>
<p>(I didn&#8217;t price in the advantages of guns in terms of preventing state tyranny and protecing freedom, which might be worth subsidizing, but my guess is that if 32% gun ownership is enough to maintain freedom, 22% gun ownership is as well)</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>In summary, with my personal confidence levels:</p>
<p>1. Scatterplots showing raw correlations between gun ownership and &#8220;gun deaths&#8221; are entirely driven by suicide, and therefore dishonest to use to prove that guns cause murder (~100% confidence)</p>
<p>2. But if you adjust for all relevant confounders, there <i>is</i> a positive correlation between gun ownership and homicide rates (~90% confidence). This relationship is likely causal (~66% confidence).</p>
<p>3. The majority of the difference between America&#8217;s murder rate and that of other First World countries is <i>not</i> because of easier access to guns in America (~90% confidence).</p>
<p>4. But some of it <i>is</i> due to easier access to guns. This is probably about 0.5 murders/100K/year.</p>
<p>5. An Australian-style gun control program <i>that worked and had no side effects</i> would probably prevent about 2,000 murders in the US. It would also prevent a much larger number of suicides. I am otherwise ignoring suicides in this piece because discussing them would make me too angry.</p>
<p>6. Probably the amount of lost gun-related enjoyment an Australian-style gun control program would cause do not outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>7. This is not really enough analysis to make me have a strong opinion about gun control, since this just looks at the correlational evidence and doesn&#8217;t really investigate the experimental evidence. Contrary to what everyone always tells you, experimental evidence doesn&#8217;t always trump correlational &#8211; there are cases where each has its strengths &#8211; but it wouldn&#8217;t be responsible to have a <i>real</i> opinion on this until I look into that too. Nevertheless, these data are at least <i>highly consistent with</i> Australia-style gun control being a good idea for the US.</p>

<p>Updateless decision theory was informally defined by Wei Dai in terms of logical conditional expected utility, where the condition corresponds to an algorithm (the agent) producing a given output (action or policy). This kind of conditional expected values can be <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=471"">formalised</a> by optimal predictors. However, since <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=522"">optimal predictor systems</a> which are required to <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=549"">apply</a> optimal predictors to decision theory generally have <em>random</em> advice, we need counterfactuals well-defined for random algorithms i.e. algorithms that produce different outputs with different probabilities depending on internal coin tosses. We propose to define these counterfactuals by a generalization of the notion of conditional expected utility which amounts to linear regression of utility with respect to the probabilities of different outputs in the space of ""impossible possible worlds."" We formalise this idea by introducing ""relative optimal predictors,"" prove the analogue of the conditional probability formula (which takes matrix form) and uniqueness theorems.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>We start by explaining the analogous construction in classical probability theory and proceed to defining the logical counterpart in the Results section.</p>

zKfRuA4iFsbiofg5j,Your transhuman copy is of questionable value to your meat self.,your-transhuman-copy-is-of-questionable-value-to-your-meat,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zKfRuA4iFsbiofg5j/your-transhuman-copy-is-of-questionable-value-to-your-meat,2016-01-06T09:03:30.949Z,14,31,142,False,False,,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">I feel safe saying that nearly everyone reading this will agree that, given sufficient technology, a perfect replica or simulation could be made of the structure and function of a human brain, producing an exact copy of an individual mind including a consciousness.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Upon coming into existence, this consciousness will have a separate but baseline-identical subjective experience to the consciousness from which it was copied, as it was at the moment of copying.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>The original consciousness will continue its own existence/ subjective experience.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>If the brain containing the original consciousness is destroyed, the consciousness within ceases to be.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>The existence or non- of a copy is irrelevant to this fact.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With this in mind, I fail to see the attraction of the many transhuman options for extra-meat existence, and I see no meaningful immortality therein, if that's what you came for.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Consciousness is notoriously difficult to define and analyze and I am far from an expert in it's study.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I define it as an awareness: the sense organ which perceives the activity of the mind.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>It is not thought.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>It is not memory or emotion.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>It is the thing that experiences or senses these things.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Memories will be gained and lost, thoughts and emotions come and go, the sense of self remains even as the self changes.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>There exists a system of anatomical structures in your brain which, by means of electrochemical activity, produces the experience of consciousness.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>If a brain injury wiped out major cognitive functions but left those structures involved in the sense of consciousness unharmed, you would, I believe, have the same central awareness of Self as Self, despite perhaps lacking all language or even the ability to form thoughts or understand to world around you.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Consciousness, this awareness, is, I believe, the most accurate definition of Self, Me, You. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>I realize this sort of terminology has the potential to sound like mystical woo.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I believe this is due to the twin effects of the inherent difficulty in defining and discussing consciousness, and of our socialization wherein these sorts of discussions are more often than not heard from Buddhists or Sufis, whose philosophical traditions have looked into the matter with greater rigor for a longer time than Western philosophy, and Hippies and Druggies who introduced these traditions to our popular culture.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I am not speaking of a magical soul.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I am speaking of a central feature of the human experience which is a product of the anatomy and physiology of the brain.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Consider the cryonic head-freeze. Ideally, the scanned dead brain, cloned, remade and restarted (or whatever) will be capable of generating a perfectly functional consciousness, and it will feel as if it is the same consciousness which observes the mind which is, for instance, reading these words; but it will not be. The consciousness which is experiencing awareness of the mind which is reading these words will no longer exist. To disagree with this statement is to say that a scanned <em>living</em> brain, cloned, remade and started will contain the exact same consciousness, not similar, the exact same thing itself, that simultaneously exists in the <em>still-living</em> original.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>If consciousness has an anatomical location, and therefore is tied to matter, then it would follow that this matter here is the exact matter as that separate matter there. This is an absurd proposition.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>If consciousness does not have an anatomical / physical location then it is the stuff of magic and woo.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">*Aside: I believe that consciousness, mind, thought, and memory are products not only of anatomy but of physiology, that is to say the ongoing electrochemical state of the brain, the constant flux of charge in and across neurons.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>In perfect cryonic storage, the anatomy (hardware) might be maintained, but I doubt the physiology (software), in the form of exact moment-in-time membrane electrical potentials and intra-and extra-cellular ion concentrations for every neuron, will be.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Therefore I hold no faith in its utility, in addition to my indifference to the existence of a me-like being in the future.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Consider the Back-Up. Before lava rafting on your orbital, you have your brain scanned by your local AI so that a copy of your mind at that moment is saved.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>In your fiery death in an unforeseen accident, will the mind observed by the consciousness on the raft experience anything differently than if it were not backed up? I doubt I would feel much consolation, other than knowing my loved ones were being cared for.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Not unlike a life insurance policy: not for one's own benefit.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I image the experience would be one of coming to the conclusion of a cruel joke at one's own expense.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Death in the shadow of a promise of immortality.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the consciousness that left the brain scanner and got on the raft is destroyed when the brain is destroyed, it benefits not at all from the reboot.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Consider the Upload.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>You plug in for a brain scan, a digital-world copy of your consciousness is made, and then you are still just you.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>You know there is a digital copy of you, that feels as if it is you, feels exactly as you would feel were it you who had travelled to the digital-world, and it is having a wonderful time, but there you still are. You are still just you in your meat brain.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>The alternative, of course, is that your brain is destroyed in the scan in which case you are dead and something that feels as if it is you is having a wonderful time.&nbsp; It would be a mercy killing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If the consciousness that is me is perfectly analyzed and a copy created, in any medium, that process is external to the consciousness that is me.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>The consciousness that is me, that is you reading this, will have no experience of being that copy, although that copy will have a perfect memory of having been the consciousness that is you reading this.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Personally, I don't know that I care about that copy.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I suppose he could be my ally in life.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>He could work to achieve any altruistic goals I think I have, perhaps better than I think that you could. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>He might want to fuck my wife, though.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>And might be jealous of the time she spends with me rather than him, and he'd probably feel entitled to all my stuff, as would I be vice versa. The Doppelganger and the Changeling have never been considered friendly beasts.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I have no firm idea where lines can be drawn on this.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Certainly consciousness can be said to be an intermittent phenomenon which the mind pieces together into the illusion of continuity.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I do not fear going to sleep at night, despite the ""loss of consciousness"" associated. If I were to wake up tomorrow and Omega assures me that I am a freshly made copy of the original, it wouldn't trouble me as to my sense of self, only to the set of problems associated with living in a world with a copy of myself.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't mourn a dead original me any more than I'd care about a copy of me living on after I'm dead, I don't imagine. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Would a slow cell by cell, or thought by thought / byte by byte, transfer of my mind to another medium: one at a time every new neural action potential is received by a parallel processing medium which takes over?<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I want to say the resulting transfer would be the same consciousness as is typing this but then what if the same slow process were done to make a copy and not a transfer?<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Once a consciousness is virtual, is every transfer from one medium or location to another not essentially a copy and therefore representing a death of the originating version?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It almost makes a materialist argument (self is tied to matter) seem like a spiritualist one (meat consciousness is soul is tied to human body at birth) which, of course, is weird place to be intellectually.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I am not addressing the utility or ethics or inevitability of the projection of the self-like-copy into some transhuman state of being, but I don't see any way around the conclusion that that the consciousness that is so immortalized will not be the consciousness that is writing these words, although it would feel exactly as if it were.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>I don't think I care about that guy.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>And I see no reason for him to be created. And if he were created, I, in my meat brain's death bed, would gain no solace from knowing he, a being which started out it's existence exactly like me, will live on.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">EDIT: Lots of great responses, thank you all and keep them coming.&nbsp; I want to bring up some of my responses so far to better define what I am talking about when I talk about consciousness.<br /><br />I define consciousness as a passively aware thing, totally independent of memory, thoughts, feelings, and unconscious hardwired or conditioned responses. It is the hard-to-get-at thing inside the mind which is aware of the activity of the mind without itself thinking, feeling, remembering, or responding. The demented, the delirious, the brain damaged all have (unless those brain structures performing the function of consciousness are damaged, which is not a given) the same consciousness, the same Self, the same I and You, as I define it, as they did when their brains were intact. Dream Self is the same Self as Waking Self to my thinking. I assume consciousness arises at some point in infancy. From that moment on it is Self, to my thinking.<br /><br />If I lose every memory slowly and my personality changes because of this and I die senile in a hospital bed, I believe that it will be the same consciousness experiencing those events as is experiencing me writing these words. That is why many people choose suicide at some point on the path to dementia.<br /><br />I recognize that not everyone reading this will agree that such a thing exists or has the primacy of existential value that I ascribe to it.<br /><br />And an addendum:<br />Sophie Pascal's Choice (hoping it hasn't already been coined): Would any reward given to the surviving copy induce you to step onto David Bowie Tesla's Prestige Duplication Machine, knowing that your meat body and brain will be the one which falls into the drowning pool while an identical copy of you materializes 100m away, believing itself to be the same meat that walked into the machine and ready to accept the reward?</p>",Usul,usul,Usul,

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Scott goes on to score himself as having made 0/3 correct predictions at the 50% confidence interval, which looks like significant overconfidence. He addresses this by noting that with only 3 data points it‚Äôs not much data to go by, and could easily have been correct if any of those results had turned out differently. His resulting calibration curve is this:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/225697eyttttp6pBj/sfnoxagz7dgdhshe14r2"" alt=""Scott Alexander's 2015 calibration curve"" width=""337"" height=""278""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">However, the commenters had other<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> </span>objections about the anomaly at 50%. After all, P(A) = 50% implies P(~A) = 50%, so the choice of ‚ÄúI will not get any new girlfriends: 50% confidence‚Äù<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>is logically equivalent to ‚ÄúI will get at least 1 new girlfriend: 50% confidence‚Äù, except that one results as true and the other false. Therefore, the question seems sensitive only to the particular phrasing chosen, independent of the outcome.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One commenter suggests that close to perfect calibration at 50% confidence can be achieved by choosing whether to represent propositions as positive or negative statements by flipping a fair coin. Another suggests replacing 50% confidence with 50.1% or some other number arbitrarily close to 50%, but not equal to it. Others suggest getting rid of the 50% confidence bin altogether.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Scott recognizes that predicting A and predicting ~A are logically equivalent, and choosing to use one or the other is arbitrary. But by choosing to only include A in his data set rather than ~A, he creates a problem that occurs when P(A) = 50%, where the arbitrary choice of making a prediction phrased as ~A would have changed the calibration results despite being the same prediction.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"">Symmetry</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This conundrum illustrates an important point about these calibration exercises. Scott chooses all of his propositions to be in the form of statements to which he assigns greater or equal to 50% probability, by convention, recognizing that he doesn‚Äôt need to also do a calibration of probabilities less than 50%, as the upper-half of the calibration curve captures all the relevant information about his calibration.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is because the calibration curve has a property of symmetry about the 50% mark, as implied by the mathematical relation P(X) = 1- P(~X) and of course P(~X) = 1 ‚ÄìP(X).</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We can enforce that symmetry by recognizing that when we make the claim that proposition X has probability P(X), we are <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">also</em> <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">simultaneously</em> making the claim that proposition ~X has probability 1-P(X). So we add those to the list of predictions and do the bookkeeping on them too. Since we are making both claims, why not be clear about it in our bookkeeping?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">When we do this, we get the full calibration curve, <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">and</em> the confusion about what to do about 50% probability disappears. Scott‚Äôs list of predictions looks like this:</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">You will by now have noticed that there will always be an even number of predictions, and that half of the predictions always are true and half are always false. In most cases, like with E and ~E, that means you get a 95% likely prediction that is true and a 5%-likely prediction that is false, which is what you would expect. However, with 50%-likely predictions, they are always accompanied by another 50% prediction, one of which is true and one of which is false. As a result, it is actually not possible to make a binary prediction at 50% confidence that is out of calibration.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The resulting calibration curve, applied to Scott‚Äôs predictions, looks like this:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/225697eyttttp6pBj/yl6jah8okxgbgdrmiil9"" alt=""no error bars"" width=""589"" height=""475""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-no-proof:yes""><br></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"">Sensitivity</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">By the way, this graph doesn‚Äôt tell the whole calibration story; as Scott noted it‚Äôs still sensitive to how many predictions were made in each bucket. We can add ‚Äúerror bars‚Äù that show what would have resulted if Scott had made one more prediction in each bucket, and whether the result of that prediction had been true or false. The result is the following graph:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/225697eyttttp6pBj/grpeptvqu2jdlq7wcuoe"" alt=""with error bars"" width=""589"" height=""475""><br></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Note that the error bars are zero about the point of 0.5. That‚Äôs because even if one additional prediction had been added to that bucket, it would have had no effect. That point is fixed by the inherent symmetry.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I believe that this kind of graph does a better job of showing someone‚Äôs true calibration. But it's not the whole story.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Ramifications for scoring calibration (updated)<br></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Clearly, it is not possible to make a binary prediction with 50% confidence that is poorly calibrated. This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise; a prediction at 50% between two choices represents the correct prior for the case where you have no information that discriminates between X and ~X. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean that you can improve your ability to make correct predictions just by giving them all 50% confidence and claiming impeccable calibration! An easy way to ""cheat"" your way into apparently good calibration is to take a large number of predictions that you are highly (&gt;99%) confident about, negate a fraction of them, and falsely record a lower confidence for those. If we're going to measure calibration, we need a scoring method that will encourage people to write down the true probabilities they believe, rather than faking low confidence and ignoring their data. We want people to only claim 50% confidence when they genuinely have 50% confidence, and we need to make sure our scoring method encourages that.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">A first guess would be to look at that graph and do the classic assessment of fit: sum of squared errors. We can sum the squared error of our predictions against the ideal linear calibration curve. If we did this, we would want to make sure we summed all the <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">individual</em> predictions, rather than the averages of the bins, so that the binning process itself doesn‚Äôt bias our score.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If we do this, then our overall prediction score can be summarized by one number:</p>

Note that because these are binary predictions, the sum of squared errors gives an optimal score if you assign the probabilities you actually believe (ie, there is no way to ""cheat"" your way to a better score by giving false confidence).</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In this case, Scott's score is S=0.139, much of this comes from the 0.4/0.6 bracket. The worst score possible would be S=1, and the best score possible is S=0. Attempting to fake a perfect calibration by everything by claiming 50% confidence for every prediction, regardless of the information you actually have available, yields S=0.25 and therefore isn't a particularly good strategy (at least, it won't make you look better-calibrated than Scott).</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Several of the commenters pointed out that log scoring is another scoring rule that works better in the general case. Before posting this I ran the calculus to confirm that the least-squares error did encourage an optimal strategy of honest reporting of confidence, but I did have a feeling that it was an <em>ad-hoc</em> scoring rule and that there must be better ones out there.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The logarithmic scoring rule looks like this:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/225697eyttttp6pBj/zklajxdxnunbfkw0udvu"" alt=""S = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_i\ln(P(X_i))"" width=""188"" height=""54""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Here again <em>X<sub>i</sub></em><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> </span>is the <em>i</em>th proposition and has a value of 1 if it is True and 0 if it is False. The base of the logarithm is arbitrary so I've chosen base ""e"" as it makes it easier to take derivatives. This scoring method gives a negative number and the closer to zero the better. The log scoring rule has the same honesty-encouraging properties as the sum-of-squared-errors, plus the additional nice property that it penalizes wrong predictions of 100% or 0% confidence with an appropriate score of minus-infinity. When you claim 100% confidence and are wrong, you are <em>infinitely</em> wrong. Don't claim 100% confidence!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In this case, Scott's score is calculated to be S=-0.42. For reference, the worst possible score would be minus-infinity, and claiming nothing but 50% confidence for every prediction results in a score of S=-0.69. This just goes to show that you can't win by cheating.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In an attempt to appear like I have better calibration than Scott Alexander, I am going to make the following predictions. For clarity I have included the inverse propositions in the list (as those are also predictions that I am making), but at the end of the list so you can see the point I am getting at a bit better.</p>

</table>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Look carefully at this table. I've thrown in a particular mix of predictions that I <em>will </em>or <em>will not</em> win the lottery on certain days, in order to use my extreme certainty about the result to generate a particular mix of correct and incorrect predictions.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To make things even easier for me, <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">I‚Äôm not even planning to buy any lottery tickets</em>. Knowing this information, an honest estimate of the odds of me winning the lottery are astronomically small. The odds of winning the lottery are about<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>1 in 14 million (for the Canadian 6/49 lottery). I‚Äôd have to win by accident (one of my relatives buying me a lottery ticket?). Not only that, but since the lottery is only held on Wednesday and Saturday, that makes most of these scenarios even <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">more</em> implausible since the lottery corporation would have to hold the draw by mistake.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I am confident I could make at least 1 billion similar statements of this exact nature and get them all right, so my true confidence must be upwards of (100% - 0.0000001%).</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If I assemble 50 of these types of strategically-underconfident predictions (and their 50 opposites) and plot them on a graph, here‚Äôs what I get:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;<img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/225697eyttttp6pBj/t2icng3oxoegxbg42hla"" alt=""Looks like good calibration...? Not so fast."" width=""589"" height=""475""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">You can see that the problem with cheating doesn‚Äôt occur only at 50%. It can occur anywhere!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But here‚Äôs the trick: The log scoring algorithm rates me -0.37. If I had made the same 100 predictions all at my true confidence (99.9999999%), then my score would have been -0.000000001. A much better score! My attempt to cheat in order to make a pretty graph has only sabotaged my score.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">By the way, what if I <em>had</em> gotten one of those wrong, and actually won the lottery one of those times without even buying a ticket? In that case my score is -0.41 (the wrong prediction had a probability of 1 in 10^9 which is about 1 in e^21, so it‚Äôs worth -21 points, but then that averages down to -0.41 due to the 49 correct predictions that are collectively worth a negligible fraction of a point).*<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> Not terrible! </span>The log scoring rule is pretty gentle about being very badly wrong sometimes, just as long as you aren‚Äôt <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">infinitely</em> wrong. However, if I had been a little less confident and said the chance of winning each time was only 1 in a million, rather than 1 in a billion, my score would have improved to -0.28, and if I had expressed only 98% confidence I would have scored -0.098, the best possible score for someone who is wrong one in every fifty times.</p>

<p>This has another important ramification: If you're going to honestly test your calibration, <em>you shouldn't pick the predictions you'll make</em>. It is easy to improve your score by throwing in a couple predictions that you are very certain about, like that you won't win the lottery, and by making few predictions that you are genuinely uncertain about. It is fairer to use a list of propositions that is generated by somebody else, and then pick your probabilities. Scott demonstrates his honesty by making public predictions about a mix of things he was genuinely uncertain about, but if he wanted to cook his way to a better score in the future, he would avoid making any predictions at the 50% category that he wasn't forced to.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Input and comments are welcome! Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>* This result surprises me enough that I would appreciate if someone in the comments can double-check it on their own. What is the proper score for being right 49 times with 1-1 in a billion certainty, but wrong once?</p>

5bd75cc58225bf06703750ab,Active learning for opaque predictors,active-learning-for-opaque-predictors,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703750ab/active-learning-for-opaque-predictors,2016-01-03T21:15:28.000Z,1,1,0,False,False,,"<html><head></head><body><p>Summary: I propose a simple <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/active-learning-for-opaque-powerful-predictors-94724b3adf06#.nv4dfmdfd"">open question</a> that is directly relevant to the feasibility of my recent AI control proposals.</p>
<p>I've recently written a lot about AI control schemes based on <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/counterfactual-human-in-the-loop-a7822e36f399#.pd9yqub93"">counterfactual oversight</a>, which are directed by predicted human behavior. A good example is described in <a href=""https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=124"">this post</a>, by Nisan.</p>
<p>Even assuming that some scheme in this family would work with perfect predictions (which is itself an open question), we would need to study how well they cope with prediction errors. Even if we had the ideal prediction algorithm, there would still be errors (since in general a sequence of observations does not uniquely determine the next observation). I want to focus on understanding the robustness of the scheme to even a minimal set of prediction errors.</p>
<p>A simple though exotic class of errors occur when a predictor is uncertain about whether observations are coming from a world where everything-is-as-it-appears, or whether they are produced by a simulation. This is an especially troubling kind of error because it may actually be adversarial (if the simulation is controlled by some consequentialist process).</p>
<p>Even setting aside such exotic errors, trying to prove worst case guarantees seems like <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/handling-adversarial-errors-4ed438af8bdd"">good idea</a>.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>There seem to be two qualitatively distinct reasons that prediction errors might cause big trouble:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system may continuously make bad predictions, in hypothetical situations that are never or only very rarely actually explored (so that the errors are never or only very rarely corrected).</li>
<li>Making a small number of bad predictions might have catastrophic consequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both problems are potentially troubling. I think that error #1 is much more important and also more fundamental, so I'll focus on that one. We can move on to problem #2 if we manage to fix problem #1.</p>
<p>Ideally we would elicit human feedback in the situations that are most informative. This could potentially address problem #1, by ensuring that we quickly explore situations where our system may be making serious or consistent errors.  In the long run it might also address problem #2, if the same techniques could be used to <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/synthesizing-training-data-f92a637dc1b4"">synthesize potentially problematic queries</a> before failures would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>The question is: how can we do this?</p>
<p>I describe the problem in more detail <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/active-learning-for-opaque-powerful-predictors-94724b3adf06#.nv4dfmdfd"">here</a>. Summarizing for this audience: assume that we have very good predictors (say, given by <a href=""https://intelligence.org/files/ReflectiveSolomonoffAIXI.pdf"">reflective oracle machines that are analogous to Solomonoff induction</a>). Each day we use these predictors to answer a large number of questions, but we only have time to get human feedback on a small number of questions. Is there some way that we can use the predictors' output to select the most important questions to get feedback on?</p>
<p>For example, suppose that our predictor assigns a 50% probability to an adversarial simulation hypothesis and a 50% probability to the intended model of our local environment. The simulation hypothesis might produce disagreements in a very small number of strategically chosen situations. But the very first time that we actually provide feedback on one of these situations, it will allow the predictor to rule out the simulation hypothesis.</p>
<p>So our goal is to ensure that we provide feedback on one of these situations as quickly as possible, minimizing the number of decisions that are made before the unintended hypothesis is eliminated. Can we use the predictor to identify these situations?</p>
<p>(I provide more formal details, and a harder follow-up question, in <a href=""https://medium.com/ai-control/active-learning-for-opaque-powerful-predictors-94724b3adf06#.nv4dfmdfd"">the post</a>.)</p>

Both are asked for an algorithm that solves some programming puzzle, such as ""identify all palindromes in a string of characters.""</p><p>The first candidate, Alice, reflexively enters problem-solving mode upon hearing the problem. She pauses for a few seconds as she internalizes the problem, and then quickly thinks up a very inefficient algorithm that finds the answer by brute force. She decides to sketch this algorithm first (as a warm up) and then turn her mind to finding a more efficient path to the answer.</p><p>The second candidate, Bob, responds very differently to the same problem. He reflexively predicts that he won't be able to solve the problem. He struggles to quiet that voice in his head while he waits for a solution to present itself, but no solution is forthcoming. He struggles to focus as the seconds pass, until a part of his brain points out that he's been quiet for an uncomfortably long time, and the interviewer probably already thinks he's stupid. From then on, his thoughts are stuck on the situation, despite his attempts to wrest them back to the task at hand.</p><p>Part of what makes the difference between Alice and Bob might be skill: Alice might have more experience that lets her solve programming puzzles with less concerted effort, which helps her get to a solution before self-doubt creeps in. Self-confidence may also be a factor: perhaps Alice is simply less prone to self-doubt, and therefore less prone to this type of self-sabotage.</p><p>A third difference between Alice and Bob is their <i>response pattern.</i> Bob begins by waiting blankly for a solution to present itself; Alice begins by checking whether she can solve a simple version of the problem (""can I solve it by brute force?""). Bob is more liable to panic when no answer comes (""I have been quiet for too long""), Alice is more liable to break the problem down further if no solution presents itself (""Can I divide and conquer?"").</p><p>This difference is also explained in part by experience: a more seasoned software engineer is more likely to <i>reflexively</i> notice that a problem can be solved with a simple recursion, and know which data structures to apply where. I don't think it's <i>only</i> experience, though. Imagine Alice and Bob both faced with a second problem, outside their usual comfort zone ‚Äî say, a friend asks them for advice about how to handle a major life-changing event. It's easy to imagine Alice attempting to understand the situation better and asking clarifying questions that help her understand how her friend is thinking about the question. It's similarly easy to imagine Bob feeling profoundly uncomfortable, while he tries to give neutral advice and worries about the fact that he might give bad advice that ruins his friend's life.</p><p>One might call what Alice is doing ""confidence,"" but that doesn't tell us <i>how it's working.</i> And 'confidence' also comes with connotations that may not apply to Alice ‚Äî she may well decide that she isn't in a position to give good advice, she may be working from a shaky understanding and thus doubt her own conclusions, even as she turns her thoughts to understanding the obstacle before her.</p><p>One of the big differences, as I see it, is the difference in the <i>response pattern</i> between Alice and Bob. Alice justs <i>gets down to addressing the obstacle before her</i>, Bob spends mental cycles floundering. Managing response patterns is something of an art: when confronted with an obstacle, does your brain switch into problem-solving gear or do you start to flail?</p><hr><p>Note that the art of response is <i>not</i> about immediately solving any problem placed before you. Sometimes, the best automatic response is to find some way to disengage or dodge. <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/"">You aren't obligated to solve every problem placed before you</a>. The goal of having appropriate response patterns is to <i>avoid flailing</i> and <i>avoid staring blankly</i>. The goal is to have your mind shift into the problem-solving gear.</p><p>Having effective responses prepared isn't necessarily a general skill. I'm a computer programmer at heart, and a few years ago I switched paths to math research. If I'm faced with a programming problem that I want to solve, I quickly and easily slip into effective-response-mode; I can often find solutions to problems reflexively, and when I can't, I reflexively examine the problem from many different viewpoints and start breaking it down. Yet, if you confront me with a math problem I want solved, there are still times when my reflexive response is to sit back and wait for someone else to solve it for me. (It doesn't help that I'm surrounded by brilliant mathematicians who can do so successfully.) That reflexive response ‚Äî the one of blanking my mind, curious while I wait for someone else to find the answer ‚Äî is not a very effective response.</p><p>Effective responses aren't about answering <i>quickly</i>, either. When paired with expertise and familiarity an effective response to an obstacle will often lead to a fast answer, but oftentimes the most effective response is to pause and think. Plenty of people have very ineffective response patterns that involve opening their mouths the moment you ask them to help you confront an obstacle. Some people reflexively start solving the wrong problem, others reflexively start making excuses for themselves, still others reflexively share personal anecdotes that paint them in a positive light. Effective response patterns are not about answering fast, they're about answering <i>well.</i></p><hr><p>The most competent people that I know are, almost universally, people who have very effective response patterns to obstacles in their areas of expertise. The good programmers I meet reflexively start breaking a problem down the moment they decide to solve it. The stellar mathematicians I know reflexively start prodding at problems with various techniques, or reflexively identify parts of the problem that they don't yet understand. The best businesspeople among my advisors are people who listen to me describe the choice before me, and reflexively describe the costs, constraints, and opportunities they observe. Each has acquired a highly effective response pattern to problems that fall within their area of expertise. This response pattern allows them to hit an obstacle and start taking it apart, with an Alice-like mindset, rather than flailing and doubting themselves as per Bob.</p><p>Confidence, practice, and talent all help develop these specific response patterns quite a bit. That said, you can often learn someone's <i>response patterns</i> with much less effort than it takes to learn their skills: you can start thinking in terms of incentives, opportunity costs, and markets long before you become a master economist (though reading a microeconomics textbook surely doesn't hurt). Competence isn't just about believing in your capabilities; it's also about having a pattern prepared that takes you directly to the ""break down the problem and gnaw on the parts"" stage without ever dumping you into the ""worry about how you've been silent for a long time and reflect on the fact that the interviewer probably thinks you're dumb"" zone.</p><p>Having an <i>explicit</i> pattern, such as a checklist, can help you switch from one pattern to the other. For example, imagine Bob in the example above had a checklist which read as follows:</p><blockquote><p><i>If I start dwelling on how likely I am to fail, I will do the following. (1) Say ""hmm, let me think for a few minutes"" aloud. (2) Verify that I understand the problem, and ask clarifying questions if I don't. (3) Check whether I could easily solve the problem by brute force. (3) Come up with a few simplifications of the problem. (4) Find a way to break off only one part of the problem or one of its simplified variants.</i></p></blockquote><p>then he may well be able to manually switch from a flailing response pattern to an effective one. This sort of manual switching is a good way to instill a new response pattern. The ultimate goal, though, is for efficient response patterns to become <i>reflexive</i>.</p><p>In fact, I think many people could benefit from developing efficient ""fallback"" response patterns, to handle new or surprising situations. Response patterns like ""verify that your observations were correct"" or ""find more data"" or ""generate more than one plausible explanation for the surprise"" and so on. As far as I can tell, there <i>is</i> a general skill of being able to smoothly handle surprising new situations and think on your feet, and I suspect this can be attained by developing good response patterns designed for surprising new situations.</p><hr><p>This advice is not new, of course. Lots of self-help advice will tell you to break down the problems before you into smaller parts, and to infuse your actions with intentionality, and to <a href=""http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/"">reflexively do the obvious things</a>, and so on. So I won't say much more on how to <i>attain</i> the Alice-like mindstate as opposed to the Bob-like mindstate. The important takeaway is that sometimes people respond to obstacles by breaking them down and other times they respond by flailing, and one way or another, it's useful to develop reflexive responses that put you into the former mindstate.</p><p>The way that I do it is by monitoring the ways that I respond to new obstacles placed before me. I watch myself facing various situations and observe which ones lead be to reflexively get defensive, or to reflexively blank my mind and wait for someone else to answer, or to reflexively freeze in shock and act dumbfounded. Then I practice building better response patterns for those situations, by figuring out what the checklists to run are, and I do my best to replace those patterns with reflexive inquiry, curiosity, requests for clarification, and impulses to take initiative. Polished response patterns have proven useful to me, and I attribute much of my skill at math, programming, and running nonprofits to having sane responses to new obstacles.</p><p>Regardless of where you get your response patterns from, I suspect that honing them will do you well.</p>",So8res,so8res,So8res,

<div>Briefly put, CFAR's mission is to improve the sanity/thinking skill of those who are most likely to actually usefully impact the world.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I'd like to explain what this mission means to me, and why I think a high-quality effort of this sort is essential, possible, and urgent.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I used a Q&amp;A format (with imaginary Q's) to keep things readable; I would also be very glad to Skype 1-on-1 if you'd like something about CFAR to make sense, as would Pete Michaud. &nbsp;You can schedule a conversation automatically with <a href=""http://www.meetme.so/cfar-anna"">me</a> or <a href=""https://secure.scheduleonce.com/cfar-pete&amp;thm=blue&amp;dt=&amp;em=1"">Pete</a>.</div>

<p><strong>Q: &nbsp;Why not focus exclusively on spreading altruism? &nbsp;Or else on ""raising awareness"" for some particular known cause?</strong></p>
<p>Briefly put: because historical roads to hell have&nbsp;been powered in part by good intentions; because the contemporary world seems <a href=""http://zerotoonebook.com/about/"">bottlenecked</a>&nbsp;by its ability to <em>figure out what to do and how to do it</em>&nbsp;(i.e. by ideas/creativity/capacity) more than by folks' willingness to sacrifice; and because rationality skill and <a href=""https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Epistemic_hygiene"">epistemic hygiene</a> seem like skills that may distinguish <em>actually useful</em>&nbsp;ideas from ineffective or harmful ones in a way that ""good intentions"" cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Q: &nbsp;Even given the above -- why focus extra on sanity, or <em>true</em> beliefs? &nbsp;Why not focus instead on, say, competence/usefulness as the key determinant of how much do-gooding impact a motivated person can have?</strong> &nbsp;(Also, have you ever met a Less Wronger? &nbsp;I hear they are annoying and have lots of problems with &ldquo;akrasia&rdquo;, even while priding themselves on their high &ldquo;epistemic&rdquo; skills; and I know lots of people who seem &ldquo;less rational&rdquo; than Less Wrongers on some axes who would nevertheless be more useful in many jobs; is this &ldquo;epistemic rationality&rdquo; thingy <em>actually</em> the thing we need for this world-impact thingy?...)</p>
<p>This is an interesting one, IMO.</p>
<p>Basically, it seems to me that epistemic rationality, and skills for forming accurate explicit world-models, become more useful the more ambitious and confusing a problem one is tackling.</p>
<p>For example:<a id=""more""></a></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">If I have one floor to sweep, it would be best to hire a person who has pre-existing skill at sweeping floors.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">If I have 250 floors to sweep, it would be best to have someone energetic and perceptive, who will stick to the task, notice whether they are succeeding, and improve their efficiency over time. &nbsp;An ""all round competent human being"", maybe.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">If I have 10^25 floors to sweep, it would... be rather difficult to win at all, actually. &nbsp;But if I <em>can</em>&nbsp;win, it probably <em>isn't</em>&nbsp;by harnessing my pre-existing skill at floor-sweeping, nor even (I'd claim) my pre-existing skill at ""general human competence"". &nbsp;It's probably by using the foundations of science and/or politics to (somehow) create some totally crazy method of getting the floors swept (a process that would probably require actually accurate beliefs, and thus epistemic rationality).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world's most important problems look to me more like that third example. &nbsp;And, again, it seems to me that to solve problems of <em>that</em>&nbsp;sort -- to iterate through many wrong guesses and somehow piece together an accurate model until one finds a workable pathway for doing what originally looked impossible -- without getting stuck in dead ends or wrong turns or inborn or societal prejudices -- it is damn helpful to have something like epistemic rationality. &nbsp;(Competence is pretty darn helpful too -- it's good to e.g. be able to go out there and get data; to be able to form networking relations with folks who already know things; etc. -- but epistemic rationality is necessary in a more fundamental way.)</p>
<p>For the sake of concreteness, I will claim that AI-related existential risk is among humanity's most important problems, and that it is damn confusing, damn hard, and really really needs something like epistemic rationality and not just something like altruism and competence if one is to impact it <em>positively</em>, rather than just, say, randomly impacting it. &nbsp;I'd be glad to discuss in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why suppose &ldquo;sanity skill&rdquo; <em>can</em> be increased?</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an easier question: why suppose thinking skills (of any sort) can be increased?</p>
<p>The answer to that one is easy: Because we see it done all the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The math student who arrives at college and does math for the first time with others is absorbing a kind of thinking skill; thus mathematicians discuss a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;mathematical maturity&rdquo;, as a property distinct from (although related to) their learning of this and that math theorem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, the coder who hacks her way through a bunch of software projects and learns several programming languages will have a much easier time learning her 8th language than she did her first; basically because, somewhere along the line, she learned to &ldquo;think like a computer scientist&rdquo;...</p>
<p>The claim that &ldquo;sanity skill&rdquo; is a type of thinking skill and that it can be increased is somewhat less obvious. &nbsp;I am personally convinced that the LW Sequences / <a href=""/lw/lvb/rationality_from_ai_to_zombies/"">AI to Zombies</a> gave me something, and gave something similar to others I know, and that hanging out in person with Eliezer Yudkowsky, Michael Vassar, Carl Shulman, Nick Bostrom, and others gave me more of that same thing; a &ldquo;same thing&rdquo; that included e.g. actually trying to figure it out, making beliefs pay rent in anticipated experience; using arithmetic to entangle different pieces of my beliefs; and so on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I similarly have the strong impression that e.g. Feynman&rsquo;s and Munger&rsquo;s popular writings often pass on pieces of this same thing; that the convergence between the LW Sequences and Tetlock&rsquo;s Superforecasting training is non-coincidental; that the convergence between CFAR&rsquo;s workshop contents and a typical MBA program&rsquo;s contents is non-coincidental (though we were unaware of it when creating our initial draft); and more generally that there are many types of thinking skill that are routinely learned/taught and that non-trivially aid the process of coming to accurate beliefs in tricky domains. &nbsp;I update toward this partly from the above convergences; from the fact that Tetlock's training seems to work; from the fact that e.g. Feynman and Munger (and for that matter Thiel, Ray Dalio, Francis Bacon, and a number of others) were shockingly conventionally successful and advocated similar things; and from the fact that there is quite a bit of ""sanity"" advice that is obviously correct once stated, but that we don't automatically do (advice like ""bother to look at the data; and try to update if the data doesn't match your predictions"").</p>
<p>So, yes, I suspect that there is some portion of sanity that can sometimes be learned and taught. &nbsp;And I suspect this portion can be increased further with work.</p>
<p><strong>Q. &nbsp;Even if you can train skills: Why go through all the trouble and complications of trying to do this, rather than trying to find and recruit people who <em>already</em>&nbsp;have the skills?</strong></p>
<div>The short version: because there don't seem to be enough people out there with the relevant skills (yet), and because it does seem to be possible to help people increase their skills with training.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>How can I tell there aren't enough people out there, instead of supposing that we haven't yet figured out how to find and recruit them?</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Basically, because it seems to me that if people had really huge amounts of epistemic rationality + competence + caring, they would already be impacting these problems. &nbsp;Their huge amounts of epistemic rationality and competence would allow them to find a path to high impact; and their caring would compel them to do it.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I realize this is a somewhat odd thing to say, and may not seem true to most readers. &nbsp;It didn't used to seem true to me. &nbsp;I myself found the idea of existential risk partly through luck, and so, being unable to picture thinkers who had skills I lacked, I felt that anyone would need luck to find out about existential risk. &nbsp;Recruiters, I figured, could fix that luck-gap by finding people and telling them about the risks.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>However, there are folks who can reason their own way to the concept. &nbsp;And there are folks who, having noticed how much these issues matter, can locate novel paths that may plausibly impact human outcomes. &nbsp;And even if there weren't folks of this sort, there would be hypothetical people of this sort; much of what is luck at some skill-levels can in principle be <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7622394"">made into skill</a>. &nbsp;So, finding that only a limited number of people are working effectively on these problems (provided one is right about that assessment) does offer an upper bound on how many people today can exceed a certain combined level of epistemic rationality, competence, and caring about the world.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>And of course, we should <em>also</em>&nbsp;work to recruit competence and epistemic skill and caring wherever we can find them. &nbsp;(To help such folk find their highest impact path, whatever that turns out to be.) &nbsp;We just shouldn't expect such recruiting to be enough, and shouldn't stop there. &nbsp;Especially given the stakes. &nbsp;And given the things that may happen if e.g. political competence, ""raised awareness"", and recruited good intentions are allowed outpace insight and good epistemic norms on e.g. AI-related existential risk, or other similarly confusing issues. &nbsp;Andrew Critch makes this point well with respect to AI safety in <a href=""http://acritch.com/miri-scaling/"">a recent post</a>; I agree with basically everything he says there.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Q. &nbsp;Why do you sometimes talk of CFAR's mission as ""improving thinking skill"", and other times talk of improving all of epistemic rationality, competence, and do-gooding? &nbsp;Which one are you after?</strong></div>
<p>The main goal is thinking skill. &nbsp;Specifically, thinking skill among those most likely to successfully use it to positively impact the world.</p>
<p>Competence and caring are relevant secondary goals: some of us have a <a href=""/lw/n39/why_cfar_the_view_from_2015/#snapshots"">conjecture</a> that deep epistemic rationality can be useful for creating competence and caring, and of course competence and caring about the world are also directly useful for impacting the world's problems. &nbsp;But CFAR wants to increase competence and caring <em>via</em>&nbsp;teaching relevant pieces of thinking skill, and not via special-case hacks. &nbsp;For example, we want to help people <a href=""/lw/n2x/the_art_of_grieving_well/"">stay tuned into what they care about even when this is painful</a>, and to help people notice their&nbsp;<a href=""/lw/21b/ugh_fields/"">aversions</a> <a href=""/lw/2q6/compartmentalization_in_epistemic_and/"">and</a> <a href=""http://acritch.com/aversions/"">sort through</a> which of their aversions are and aren't based in accurate implicit models. &nbsp;We do not want to use random emotional appeals to boost specific cause areas, nor to use other special-case hacks that happen to boost efficacy in a manner opaque to participants.</p>
<p>Why focus primarily on thinking skill? &nbsp;Partly so we can have focus enough as an organization so as to actually do anything at all. &nbsp;(Organizations that try to accomplish several things at once risk accomplishing none -- and ""epistemic rationality"" is more of a single thing.) &nbsp;Partly so our workshop participants and other learners can similarly have focus as learners. &nbsp;And partly because, as discussed above, it is very very hard to intervene in global affairs in such a way as to <em>actually have <strong>positive</strong> outcomes, </em>and not merely outcomes one pretends will be positive; and focusing on actual thinking skill seems like a better bet for problems as confusing as e.g. existential risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why include competence and caring at all, then? &nbsp;Because high-performing humans make use of large portions of their minds (I think), and if we focus only on ""accurate beliefs"" in a narrow sense (e.g., doing analogs of Tetlocks forecasting training and nothing else), we are apt to generate ""straw lesswrongers"" whose ""rationality"" applies mainly to their explicit beliefs... people who can nitpick incorrect statements and can in this way attempt accurate verbal statements, but who are not creatively generative, do not have the iterated energy/competence/rapid iteration required to launch a startup, and cannot run good fast realtime social skills. &nbsp;We aim to do better. &nbsp;And we suspect that working to hit competence and caring <em>via</em>&nbsp;what one might call ""deep epistemic rationality"" is a route in.</p>
<p><strong>Q. &nbsp;Can a small organization realistically do all that without losing Pomodoro virtue? &nbsp;(By ""Pomodoro virtue"", I mean the ability to focus on one thing at a time and so to actually make progress, instead of losing oneself amidst the distraction of 20 goals.)</strong></p>
<p>We think so, and we think the new core/labs division within CFAR will help. &nbsp;Basically, Core will be working to scale up the workshops and related infrastructure, which should give a nice trackable set of numbers to optimize -- numbers that, if grown, will enable better financial health for CFAR and will also enable a much larger set of people to train in rationality.</p>
<p>Labs will be focusing on impacting smaller numbers of people who are poised to impact existential risk (mainly), and on seeing whether our ""impacts"" on these folk do in fact seem to help with their impact on the world.</p>
<p>We will continue to work together on many projects and to trade ideas frequently, but I suspect that this separation into two goals will give more ""pomorodo virtue"" to the whole organization.</p>
<p><strong>Q. &nbsp;What is CFAR's relationship to existential risk? &nbsp;And what should it be?</strong></p>
<p>CFAR's mission is to improve the sanity/thinking skill of those who are most likely to actually usefully impact the world -- via whatever cause areas may be most important. &nbsp;Many of us suspect that AI-related existential risk is an area with huge potential for useful impact; and so we are focusing partly on helping meet talent gaps in that field. &nbsp;This focus also gives us more ""pomodoro virtue"" -- it is easier to track whether e.g. the MIRI Summer Fellows Program helped boost research on AI safety, than it is to track whether a workshop had ""good impacts on the world"" in some more general sense.</p>
<p>It is important to us that the focus remain on ""high impact pathways, whatever those turn out to be"", that we do not propagandize for particular pre-set answers (rather, that we assist folks in thinking things through in an unhindered way), and that we work toward a kind of thinking skill that may let people better assess what paths are <em>actually</em>&nbsp;high impact for having positive effects in the world, and to overcome flaws in our current thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. &nbsp;Should I do &ldquo;Earning to Give&rdquo;? &nbsp;Also: I heard that there are big funders around now and so &ldquo;earning to give&rdquo; is no longer a sensible thing for most people to do; is that true? &nbsp;And what does all this have to do with CFAR?</strong></p>
<div>IMO, earning to give remains a pathway for creating very large positive impacts on the world.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>For example, CFAR, MIRI, and many of the organizations under the CEA umbrella seem to me to be both high potential impact, and substantially funding limited right now, such that further donation is likely to cause a substantial increase in how much good these organizations accomplish.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This is an interesting claim to make in a world where e.g. Good Ventures, Elon Musk, and others are already putting very large sums of money into making the world better; if you expect to make a large difference via individual donation, you must implicitly expect that you can pick donation targets for your own smallish sum better than they could, at least at the margin. &nbsp;(One factor that makes this more plausible is that you can afford to put in far more time/attention/thought per dollar than they can.)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Alternately stated: the world seems to me to be short, not so much on money, as on understanding of what to do with money; and an ""Earning to Give"" career seems to me to potentially make sense insofar as it is a decision to <em>really actually try to figure out&nbsp;</em>how to get humanity to a win-state (or how to otherwise do whatever it is that is actually worthwhile), especially insofar as you seem to see low-hanging fruit for high-impact donation. &nbsp;Arguing with varied others who have thought about it is perhaps the fastest route toward a better-developed inside view, together with setting a 5 minute timer and attempting to solve it yourself. &nbsp;""Earning to give""ers, IMO, contribute in proportion to the amount of non-standard epistemic skill they develop, and not just in proportion to their giving amount; and, much as with Giving Games, knowing that you matter today can provide a <a href=""/lw/nb/something_to_protect/"">reason</a> to develop a worldview for real.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This has to do with CFAR both because I expect us to accomplish far more good if we have money to do it, and because folks <em>actually trying to figure out how to impact the world</em>&nbsp;are building the kind of thinking skill CFAR is all about.</div>",AnnaSalamon,annasalamon,AnnaSalamon,

We decided to do so because we looked around for organizations that would provide marketing resources for our own local activism in Columbus, OH, trying to convey these ideas to a broad public and found no such organizations. So we decided &ndash; if not us, then who? If not now, then when? My wife would use her </span><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;""><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/agnesvishnevkin""><span style=""color: #1155cc;"">experience in nonprofits</span></a><span style=""color: black;""> to run the organisation, while I would use my </span><a href=""https://history.osu.edu/people/tsipursky.1""><span style=""color: #1155cc;"">experience as a professor</span></a><span style=""color: black;""> to work on content and research.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black;"">We gathered together a group of local aspiring rationalists and Effective Altruists interested in the project, and launched the organization publicly in 9/2014. We got our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, began running various content marketing experiments, and established the internal infrastructure. We also built up a solid audience in the secular and skeptical market, who we saw as the easiest-to-reach audience with promoting effective giving and rational thinking. By the early fall of 2015, we had established some connections and reputation, a solid social media following, and our articles began to be accepted in prominent venues that reach a broad audience, such as The Huffington Post and Lifehack. At that point, we felt comfortable enough to begin our active engagement with the EA movement, as we felt we could provide added value. </span></p>

I did not feel comfortable speaking out about that until I had built up InIn enough to be able to speak from a position of some expertise in the early fall of 2015, and to demonstrate right away the benefit we could bring through publishing widely-shared articles that promoted EA messages. </span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black;"">Looking back, I wish I had started engaging with the EA Forum sooner. It was a big mistake on my part that caused some EAs to treat InIn as a sudden outsider that burst on the scene. Also, our early posts were perceived as too self-promotional. I guess this is not surprising, looking back &ndash; although the goal was simply to demonstrate our value, the content marketing nature of our work does show through. Ah well, lessons learned and something to update on for the future. </span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black;"">1A) Note: we focus on spreading ideas like effective giving without associating them overtly with the movement of Effective Altruism, though leaving buried hooks to EA in the articles. This approach has the benefit minimizing the risk of diluting the movement with less value-aligned members, while leaving opportunities for those who are more value-aligned to find the EA movement. Likewise, we don&rsquo;t emphasize EA as we believe that overt uses of labels can lead some people to perceive our messages as ideological, which would undermine our ability to build rapport with them. </span></p>

This not only increases their own flourishing, but also expands their circles of caring beyond biases based on geographical location (drowning child problem), species (non-human animals), and temporal distance (existential risk). </span></p>

Post what you're reading, listening to, watching, and your opinion of it. Post recommendations to blogs. Post whatever media you feel like discussing! To see previous recommendations, check out the <a href=""/r/discussion/tag/media_thread/"">older threads</a>.</p>
<p>Rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please avoid downvoting recommendations just because you don't personally like the recommended material; remember that liking is a <a href=""/lw/ro/2place_and_1place_words/"">two-place word</a>. If you can point out a specific flaw in a person's recommendation, consider posting a comment to that effect.</li>
<li>If you want to post something that (you know) has been recommended before, but have another recommendation to add, please link to the original, so that the reader has both recommendations.</li>
<li>Please post only under one of the already created subthreads, and never directly under the parent media thread.</li>
<li>Use the ""Other Media"" thread if you believe the piece of media you want to discuss doesn't fit under any of the established categories.</li>
<li>Use the ""Meta"" thread if you want to discuss about the monthly media thread itself (e.g. to propose adding/removing/splitting/merging subthreads, or to discuss the type of content properly belonging to each subthread) or for any other question or issue you may have about the thread or the rules.</li>
